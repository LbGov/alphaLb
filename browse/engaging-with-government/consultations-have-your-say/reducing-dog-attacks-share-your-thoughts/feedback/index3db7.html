											<h4>
												Please explain why this is the biggest contributing factor:
											</h4>
											<div>
												This can only come about by a culture change in the Animal Control departments. CURRENTLY it is obvious that there is too much focus on ENFORCEMENT and virtually none or very little on EDUCATION. We ALL recognise that the current system is not working. Currently we are embarrassed with the present culture of Animal Control and the mentality of most Animal Control Officers that seem to adopt more bully tactics focusing on enforcing and infringing and with more often than not a focus of killing the problematic dog. This is in place of education and training the dog owner. They seem to think that by eradicating the problematic dog ,that fixes the problem. In fact, we believe that this mentality and action has a negative effect as it is generally these dog owners who go straight out and replace those dogs and then you are back to square one! The result being, is that you not only have an uneducated dog owner but you have also now alienated them against the ACO’s . These are the very people that the ACO’s should be having a rapport with and working along side.

											<div>
												The nub of the dog attacks issue IS dog owner responsibility but to achieve this requires PROPER EDUCATION AND TRAINING ! And this can only come about by a culture change in the Animal Control departments. CURRENTLY it is obvious that there is too much focus on ENFORCEMENT and virtually none or very little on EDUCATION.
we also strongly believe that a free desexing programme for everyone would make huge inroads - even if it only for 4-5 years - minimising the strays roaming and minimising cross breeding. We believe that this would also be saving the rate payers lots of money instead of it being spent employing Animal Control to constantly spend valuable time on stray, roaming dogs. We are regularly asked by members of the public if there is such a service for free desexing that still exists - and when it will be available. We have no doubt whatsoever that this would decrease the number of strays and in doing so reduce dog attacks. EDUCATION in schools is also essential. This should be carried out by an ACO that can connect with people, have good communication skills, P.R skills. It is apparent that this is lacking in the current ACO culture. 

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you have any further suggestions to reduce the risk and harm of dog attacks?
											</h4>
											<div>
												We also advocate that there needs to be change in their classification method - a dog should be classified on their DEED not their BREED. Why should a vicious lab not be classified on its breed when a lovely natured pitiful is automatically classified that shows no aggression? IN SUMMARY the following is our proactive changes to get a safer community- 
Change Personnel in Animal Control throughout NZ- leads to change in Animal Control culture -
Education !-
Free desexing-
Reducing amount of ‘unwanted’ dogs-
Increased good dog behaviour - leads to-
Reduction in dog attacks
Change of classification - DEED NOT BREED
 My husband and I would be certainly interested in a trial or pilot programme, if it was funded. We believe that we are geographically situated ideally to cover two cities effectively covering two city Councils and are a part of NZ where there is a perfect environment for such a programme.  We genuinely believe that we could get positive results in this area. Usually these vulnerable and low socio economic people cannot afford the impound fee, infringement or prosecution costs so loose their dogs which usually result in the dog being euthanised. These dog owners then simply replace the dog with another- starting the cycle again. Excuse the pun but we are  ‘just chasing our tails’ .

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												If you selected 'Other', please explain how dog owners can reduce attacks.
											</h4>
											<div>
												There should be funding or programmes available for people to afford the training or education programmes. Another important point is the need to SOCIALISE a dog. We believe that this is the major key to having a non aggressive dog. We have seen the affect of this hard line culture on the public and pets often resulting in:

dog owners too scared to ‘socialise’ their dog - even on a lead- as they are afraid that if their dog misbehaves (through lack of education)  they may end up under the subject of an unreasonable, intimidating ACO that treats them unjustly potentially ending up loosing their dog. This discourages socialising which is an essential part of dog behaviour. 
an unfavourable response from dog owners towards the Animal Control Officers (especially if their beloved dogs have been euthanised in past history), causing at times dog owners lashing out with retaliation and non compliance. 
Individuals from a low socio economic group, feel even less encouraged to approach the officers for advice or education e.g if one had a dog that was nipping the family members, he may be fearful that his dog would be seized if he approached the ACO’s for advise for help

												We believe that a 'Nationwide job description with specific attributes for an Animal Control Officer' are essential to obtain a consistent, educational, approachable culture throughout NZ.  We believe that future employment selection should be focused on empathy and compassion, the ability to also work under considerable confrontation, have dog training knowledge or experience (or a desire to be taught and are teachable). We also believe that enforcement experience is desirable but not essential . We consider that dog control staff should have the ability to have a holistic approach to all pet ownership and to all situations they are faced with. This is essential in order to also identify the areas required for EDUCATION. To be proactive the ACO needs to engage in EDUCATING the dog owner on dog training techniques, how to deal with aggression and how to positively re-establish the order of leadership in the family WITH the dog - and so change the dogs behaviour.  The ACO can also provide them with information or links to reinforcing “how to teach your dog to see YOU as the pack leader” and the necessity for socialisation your dog with people and other dogs.

											<div>
												The question that we are either faced with or we see on public comments is - “you should not have a dog if you cannot afford one” . We find this attitude narrow minded as firstly in this unstable, changeable economic climate that we are in - we ALL  not secure in our financial situation. Secondly the fact is - it is a FACT that people love dogs and desire to have dogs and so will have dogs - whether they can or cannot afford it. We or government cannot control this. So with this in mind, we need to then target the group of individuals that are most vulnerable to dog attacks-  as it is them that as records show, have the highest percentage of dog bites/ attacks. leglisation needs to be changed in the view that the dog owner has more rights to education and advice in a secure setting. Also that there is more funding or access to dog training/ behaviour education for dog owners that cannot afford the dog obedience classes. The word 'discernment' should also be able to be excerised where appropriate. Alot of enforcing is done when it is not even been the Dog owners fault.

I have seen normally  wellbehaved goad a dog for "fun".  
Also if a stranger enters a property a dog owner should restrain the dog imrediately.

												The dog owner is the one that controls their dog/s therefore they have the ability to reduce any potential dog attacks by being responsible and controlling their dog effectively in all situations.
The Dog Control Act 1996 specifies `Dog Owner Obligations` in Section 5.  
In this section it says:
`to ensure that the dog is kept under control at all times` 
`to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the dog does not injure, endanger, intimidate, or otherwise cause distress to any person`
Over the past five years (2010-2015) ACC have recorded a total of 74,229 dog bite injuries nationally.
There needs to be more education and enforcement regarding dog control in New Zealand. 
The national dog database shows that in 2006/07 registration year there were 432603 dogs registered in NZ. In the 2014/15 year there was 543356. Therefore an increase of 110753 dogs.
Thousands and Thousands of complaints are made each year in NZ regarding uncontrolled dogs.
Public Safety is the key factor and people need to feel safe in public areas and not be intimidated by uncontrolled dogs and irresponsible owners.

												Better/more signage in reserves that bring more awareness to the dog control requirements in specific public areas. For example `dogs on leads` areas; and playgrounds where dogs are prohibited.
When there are bylaws in place then the council should enforce these laws and give infringements to dog owners who do not abide by them. This is fair and right.
Good dog owners should be role models and be rewarded for their responsible behaviour. 
There should be more incentive schemes to encourage dog owners to become more responsible eg reduction in price of dog leads. I recently  had a competition for a dog owner to win a lead:
https://postanote.co.nz/animals/dogs/a-chance-to-win-a-lead-for-your-dog_i31442#.V6--ptRoq70
Police need to address the dog control issue more, as it is not just about possible injury from dog attacks but also about bullying/intimidation/harassment/offensive behaviour/language from some dog owners towards members of the public (when they rightly ask dog owners to control their dogs)

More relevant educational resources in schools and in the community to let people know about dog control/safety. ( NB Some councils are doing some great educational work)
Taking dog complaints more seriously. If a person is rushed at, or feels intimidated, by a dog then councils need to take this more seriously. More inspections of properties, where dog/s are, that have poor fencing and better follow up to see what dog owner has done to improve fencing.
Making sure that specific Bylaw rules are adhered to by dog owners. If dog owners do not have their dogs on leads in a `dogs on leads` area then they should receive an infringement. This is fair and right.
Better/clearer and more signage to raise awareness of dog control requirements in public areas. (NB Some councils are improving signage but more needs to be done in some public areas.)

												Government needs to monitor Councils Bylaws to make sure that they (council) are attending to relevant complaints pertaining to that bylaw. If an area is a `dogs on leads` designated area then any complaints, of dogs off leads, should be specifically recorded in the Councils annual report (Section 10A of the Dog Control Act 1996).
By monitoring Councils more efficiently this will hopefully improve the way that council attend to complaints and therefore increase awareness out in the community that may potentially reduce attacks.
Government needs to introduce a more standard reporting method for all councils. ALL councils need to get their Annual reports in by a certain date so that National information is available to the public.
There needs to be a set definition of `Control` in the Dog Control Act 1996.
Encouraging Councils to do more education and more enforcement.
Representatives from Government meeting with Council and community people (dog and non dog owners, for fair representation) in different regions annually. This would be to discuss any issues and any positive things.

												Please explain why this is the biggest contributing factor:
											</h4>
											<div>
												All dogs have the potential to bite, therefore I do not believe that there is a ‘single biggest contributing factor’ to dog bite events. The likelihood of dog bites is multifactorial and associated with at least five interacting factors: individual dog genetics; socialisation; training experiences; physical and psychological health; and the context of the incident (e.g. behaviour of the victim and handler).  The influence of each factor varies between each incident.
It is always a dog owner’s responsibility to safely control their dog. Dog owners and non-dog owners need to be educated about dog behaviour and body language, and appropriate ways to interact with dogs. 
Analysis of bite statistics by breed type are inaccurate, due to problems associated with visual identification of dog breed. Research  shows that accurate visual identification of the predominant breed in mixed breed dogs is not possible. It is not right to place blame on one dog breed and in fact I believe it likely makes the dog bite situation worse. If one breed is frequently blamed for dog bites, people will be lulled into a false sense of security thinking that dog breeds, other than the one being blamed, will not bite them.

											<div>
												A comprehensive education programme that uses appropriate positive training methods is needed. Negative training methods are associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems in dogs, such as aggression. There should be a centrally maintained list of reputable dog trainers who use positive training methods that the public can access.
Current breed specific legislation should be repealed so that there can be a greater focus on the adequate and proper enforcement of dog control laws. Effective regulations need proper funding and should provide incentives for responsible dog owners, whilst ensuring there are adequate penalties and enforcement if dog owners act irresponsibly. 
Initiatives that have been successful at reducing dog attacks in other countries included a combination of incentives and penalties. For example, Calgary, Canada, successfully reduced dog bite incidents by investing in education for dog owners and children, and increasing penalties for owners in breach of registration regulations and owners of dogs that have bitten.
Oregon, USA, also implemented a model that reduced repeat biting incidents. This focused on the early identification of potentially dangerous dogs by implementing a “potentially dangerous dog” classification system based on significant factors in the dog’s life, not the breed of the dog.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you have any further suggestions to reduce the risk and harm of dog attacks?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Licencing owners and dog breeders provides the opportunity to control the serial ownership, breeding, and dispersal of dogs that have the experiences associated with an increased risk of biting, and the characteristics that make their bites so injurious.
Owner licencing incorporating appropriate owner education and dog training would provide support for responsible dog owners, whilst still allowing an enforcement framework for non-compliant dog owners. 
All people who want to breed dogs should need to obtain a licence and adhere to guidelines which require responsible breeding practices (these should include selection of appropriate and non-aggressive dogs for breeding, providing adequate and appropriate care and facilities to protect the physical and behavioural wellbeing of the dogs/puppies, including appropriate socialisation of puppies and their parents).
A regulatory framework that restricts the breeding of dogs to licenced breeders only, subject to breeder guidelines and standards, can be utilised to reduce aggression and has the potential to reduce the number of unwanted animals and consequently the number of free-roaming dogs.
All establishments that sell/rehome dogs and puppies should be licenced with a requirement to desex dogs/puppies prior to sale and provide appropriate socialisation to meet their age appropriate behavioural and physical needs.

												All dogs should be desexed unless their owner has obtained a breeding licence.  Entire dogs are more likely to bite than desexed dogs. 
Adequate and appropriate socialisation of puppies is vitally important, especially between 3 -12 weeks of age. This is the joint responsibility of breeders and owners. Safe and positive experiences during this critical period reduce the incidence of behavioural problems, including aggression.
Owners should obtain their dog/puppy from a reputable source where the behavioural appropriateness of the parents and/or dog could be evaluated and early socialisation and environmental needs were provided. 
Owners should improve their knowledge and understanding of dog behaviour. Appropriate socialisation, training and exercise are important to reduce behavioural problems, including aggression. 
Owners should seek early support from a reputable professional who uses positive training for behavioural problems, particularly aggression. Dogs implicated in serious attacks are more likely to have previously exhibited behavioural problems. 
Owners should identify and manage situations that potentially pose a bite risk including supervising interactions between children and dogs, not routinely chaining dogs (chained dogs are more likely to bite than unchained dogs) and early identification and treatment of injury/illness (dogs that are in pain are more likely to bite).

												Current breed specific legislation should be repealed to allow greater focus on adequate and proper enforcement of dog control laws. Adequate funding is needed for enforcing effective regulations and public education, especially for children. The majority of reported dog victims are children under the age of 15.  
Councils should inspect the properties of all dog owners (for initial registrations/address changes) to allow early identification of problems posing a potential risk for dog bite incidents (e.g. chaining dogs or inadequate fencing) and provide owner education about dog bite prevention. 
A consistent approach is needed for dog bite incident investigation, categorisation, recording and handling according to the incident’s severity and circumstances. 
Councils should provide incentives and support for compliance and responsible dog ownership, to balance non-compliance penalties. This also provides an opportunity to enhance their public image.
Councils should require all establishments that sell/rehome dogs/puppies to desex the animals prior to sale unless to a register breeder. Entire dogs are more likely to bite than de-sexed dogs. 
All establishments that sell/rehome animals should provide adequate and age-appropriate socialisation for dogs/puppies. Deficits in socialisation during sensitive periods of development are associated with increased risk of behavioural problems, including aggression.

												Implement a coordinated national evidence-based education programme about dog behaviour, bite prevention, and responsible dog ownership.  
Ensure consistency of bite prevention and responsible dog ownership messages from all levels of government.
Implement a national dog bite incident database, with mandatory reporting. Dog details would need to be recorded descriptively as visual breed identification alone is inaccurate.
Remove breed specific legislation (BSL).  BSL has never been shown to be effective, is not supported by current scientific evidence, and diverts resources away from effective strategies such as education, training, desexing campaigns, and registration enforcement. BSL does not reduce public risk and is likely to create even more risk of harm from dogs, due to the incorrect belief that dogs other than those that have been banned are ‘safe’. 
Implement a regulatory framework requiring all people who want to breed dogs to obtain a licence.
Require that all dogs and puppies are desexed prior to sale/transfer of ownership or release back to their owner after impoundment. 
Require that all establishments that sell/rehome animals provide adequate and age-appropriate socialisation for dogs/puppies. Deficits in socialisation during sensitive periods of development are associated with increased risk of behavioural problems, including aggression.

Parks and reserves need to have more areas where families with dogs can go and be a family.  Dog training clubs should be supported by the local councils when they are offering services at affordable rates, that enable people understand their dogs temperament and personality and to get individual guidance on how to best bring out the most balanced behaviour in their dog (and also deal with problem behaviours).  Efforts to educate the public as to how to behave around dogs should continue to be supported, and even further developed.

												I think dog attacks would be reduced if instead of perceiving dogs as a problem, the council proactively recognised their importance to the well being of their owners.  I would support the council more proactively seeking to nurture healthy, happy,  'dog wise' living.  This could be achieved by increasing educational opportunities for dog owners and 'would be' dog owners, and also, the number of places dog owners can take their dogs.  By doing this the council would be fostering a social norm in which the ignorance and poor dog care, that underpins dog attacks would be increasingly obvious, unacceptable, isolated and easier to confront.

												ALL dogs have the potential to bite and there is no ‘single biggest contributing factor’ to dog bite incidents. However, if one reason must be chosen I believe that the owner is the greatest contributor to the occurrence of dog bite incidents.
Dog owners have a responsibility to safely control their dog. Dogs that are not properly socialised, trained and contained are frequently involved in bite incidents. These are all factors modifiable by the owner.
Dog owners and non-dog owners need to be educated about dog behaviour and body language, and appropriate ways to interact with dogs.

												All dogs should be desexed unless their owner has obtained a breeding licence.  
Adequate and appropriate socialisation of puppies is vitally important, especially during between 3 -12 weeks of age. This is the joint responsibility of breeders and owners. 
Dogs/puppies should only be able to be obtained from reputable sources where the behavioural appropriateness of the parents and/or dog could be evaluated and early socialisation and environmental needs were provided. Therefore, licensing of all establishments/people selling dogs is needed. 
Education about dog behaviour, ppropriate socialisation, training and exercise is important as these are ways to reduce behavioural problems, including aggression. 
Owners should be encouraged to seek early support from a reputable professional who uses positive training for behavioural problems, particularly aggression.
Owners need to supervise interactions between children and dogs, not routinely chain dogs (chained dogs are more likely to bite than unchained dogs) and identify and treat injury/illness early (dogs that are in pain are more likely to bite). These are all situations which can increase the risk of a bite incident and need to be identified and managed by dog owners.

												Please explain why this is the biggest contributing factor:
											</h4>
											<div>
												There is no ‘single biggest contributing factor’ to dog bite incidents. ALL dogs have the potential to bite. Many studies have shown that the tendency of a dog to bite is multifactorial and associated with at least five interacting factors: the individual dog’s genetic makeup; socialisation; training experiences (especially during sensitive periods of development); physical and psychological health; and the context of the incident including the behaviour of the victim and handler.  The degree to which any one factor influences the behaviour of a dog varies according to the unique characteristics associated with each incident.
However, for this question it is necessary to choose one answer. Despite dog bite incidents being multifactorial, ultimately it is a dog owner’s responsibility to safely control their dog and identify and manage situations that have the potential to pose a bite risk. The evidence shows that the behaviour of dog owners often contributes to dog bite incidents because dogs that are not desexed, properly socialised, trained (using positive reinforcement methods) and contained are frequently involved in these incidents. Owners should always supervise interactions between children and dogs, not routinely chain dogs (as chained dogs are more likely to bite than unchained dogs) and ensure the early identification and treatment of injury or illness (as dogs that are in pain are more likely to bite).

												Licence owners and dog breeders. This would provide the opportunity to control the serial ownership, breeding and dispersal of dogs that have the characteristics and experiences associated with an increased risk of biting (i.e. a combination of genetics, poor physical and/or psychological environment, socialisation and training experiences). Develop a regulatory framework that restricts the breeding of dogs to licenced breeders only, subject to breeder guidelines and standards, to reduce heritable aggression. Breeder registration and enforcement also has the potential to reduce the number of unwanted animals and consequently the number of free-roaming dogs.
All establishments that sell or rehome dogs and puppies should be licenced with a requirement to desex dogs/puppies prior to sale and provide appropriate socialisation to meet the age appropriate behavioural and physical needs of the animal. Adequate and appropriate socialisation of puppies is vitally important, especially during the sensitive period of 3 -12 weeks of age. Safe and positive experiences during this critical period reduce the incidence of behavioural problems, including aggression.
A comprehensive education programme that uses appropriate training methods and positive reinforcement is needed. Training methods using punishment are associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems in dogs, including aggression.

												Do you have any further suggestions to reduce the risk and harm of dog attacks?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Repeal Breed Specific Legislation (BSL). Banning certain dog breeds is NOT a good way to reduce dog bite incidents. The evidence shows that BSL which involves targeting and banning certain dog breeds, is not effective at reducing public risk and is likely to create even more risk of harm from dogs, due to the incorrect belief that dogs other than those that have been banned are ‘safe’. 
Breed alone is not an effective indicator or predictor of aggression in dogs. Furthermore, it is not possible to accurately classify the predominant breed in mixed breed dogs of the types usually targeted by BSL using either visual or DNA identification.
In fact, some studies have shown that smaller breeds are more likely to display human directed aggression than larger breeds.
BSL disregards the potential negative influence of dog owners. Inappropriate owners who want an aggressive dog can encourage that behaviour in many types, whether they are banned or not. Negative deeds of some owners and dogs should be managed, not a generalised blanket ban enacted which does nothing to impact the occurrence of dog bites.

												Owners should:
- Ensure they obtain their dog/puppy from a reputable source. This source should evaluate the behavioural appropriateness of the parents and/or dog and provide age-appropriate early socialisation and environmental needs for the dog/puppy. 
- Ensure that their dog/puppy has been adequately socialised as mentioned earlier.
- Improve their knowledge and understanding of dog behaviour - Appropriate and life-long socialisation, training (using positive reinforcement) and exercise are important to reduce behavioural problems, including aggression. 
- Seek early support from a reputable professional for behavioural problems, particularly aggression. Dogs implicated in serious bite incidents are more likely to have previously exhibited behavioural problems. If these problems were addressed early by a professional then subsequent dog bite incidents would be less likely to occur.
- Always supervise interactions between children and dogs.
- Desex pets as entire dogs are more often implicated in dog bite incidents.
- Not routinely chain dogs (chained dogs are more likely to bite than unchained dogs).
- Ensure the early identification and treatment of injury or illness (dogs that are in pain are more likely to bite).

												Stop targeting dogs by breed and focus on deeds..of dogs and dog owners.  Early identification and intervention of risk factors will reduce dog bites NOT the flawed focus on the look of a dog.  All dogs have the potential to bite.

Councils should inspect the properties of all dog owners (when an owner initially register their dog and also if they change their address) to allow early identification of dog ownership issues posing a potential risk for dog bite incidents (e.g. chaining dogs or inadequate fencing).
This also provides opportunities for owner education about dog bite prevention. 

Adequate funding is needed for enforcing effective regulations and public education, especially for children. 
Councils should provide incentives and support for compliance and responsible dog ownership, to balance the requirement for non-compliance penalties. This also provides an opportunity for local councils to enhance their public image in relation to dog control.
Incentives and support could include providing subsidised puppy and/or dog training courses as part of new owner education and responsible dog ownership programmes.
Councils should require all establishments that sell/rehome animals to require all dogs/puppies to be desexed prior to sale and ensure they provide adequate and age-appropriate socialisation for dogs/puppies.
