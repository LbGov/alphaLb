											<h4>
												Please explain why this is the biggest contributing factor:
											</h4>
											<div>
												I believe this as the enforcement and stringent monitoring of how people have dogs in their control is paramount. Dog owners would also be a major contributing factor. We have been dog owners in the past, taken the responsibility seriously but stunned by the slackness of other owners in regards to law and safety.

											<h4>
												If you selected 'Other' as the best way to reduce dog attacks, please explain.
											</h4>
											<div>
												Have all dogs fully under control, no off lead dogs. All dogs fenced. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you have any further suggestions to reduce the risk and harm of dog attacks?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Very strict laws, penalties and enforcement of dogs not under control, dog attacks and irresponsible ownership. Banning dangerous breeds is vital. I believe the there is too much cloudiness about what owners are actually expected to do.

											</h4>
											<div>
												Seizing dogs immediately on the first complaint. We have had a serious history of being terrorised by a neighbours dig and the council were powerless to support us until things got very dangerous. I felt very sorry for them as they were not able to seize the dog legally.

											<div>
												Most dog bites occur in and around the home to family members.  Family members are not educated about dog behaviour and fail to recognise situations and react to calm things down.  As has been well publicized Children are allowed to harass animals without intervention from the parents / dog owners which results in dog bites in and around the home.

												Stop back yard breeding - get a team out there to reduce and stop back yard breeding.

None of these owners have any idea about dog behaviour.

												Educate owners - but the problem is that they first have to be tracked down. 
Harsh penalties and imprisonment for owners that do not register their dogs
Harsh penalties for ill treatment of dogs - which results in the animals becoming defensive and bites occurring. 
Ban chaining dogs - these animals are nearly always ill treated and not socialised.  Failure to comply should results in hefty fines and imprisonment. 
More off leash areas for people to be able to socialise their dogs.  A well socialised dog is a happy dog and highly unlikely to bite anyone.

												This question is flawed by design: 

Reported bites provides no information about context and therefore probable cause. 

Human bite statistics ignore the important issue of dog/dog aggression and the failure to define the value-laden word “attack” makes it impossible to reliably compare individual responses. 

Attack means a deliberate offensive act calculated to cause injury, and using that word suggests even informed submitters appear to agree these flaws do not exist. 

Additionally the DIA cannot pretend that all scientifically robust and credible research in NZ and overseas in at least the last two decades confirms attacks (and even single bites) lack a single cause.

One such obvious example is the 2013 American Veterinary Medical Association study that concluded victim behaviour contributed to 77% fatalities, further exacerbated by general dog mismanagement (37%) and maltreatment (21%). 

DIA is fully aware breed and size are not contributing factors except in dogs deliberately line-bred for an aggressive temperament. 

This question purports to measure an undefined variable produced from inaccurately incomplete information before asking for onion on matters known to be completely irrelevant. 

I selected education because the DIA cannot participate in an intelligent discussion of dog control without first obtaining an understanding of basic issues.

											<div>
												It is unacceptable to constantly refer to breed when it is conclusively proven it is neither a cause or even an indicator of aggressive temperament. The question is further flawed by proposing options that assume attacks are a normal aspect of normal dog behaviour despite all research (see above AVMA example) showing victim conduct and historical animal management are more likely causes. 

This is particularly misdirected given the well-published 2014 Bristol University survey of four thousand dogs which concluded less than 3% of dogs exhibited aggressive behaviour despite the definition including the extremely mild indicator of any type of barking. 

Whatever DIA means by “attacks” can only be reduced by implementing solutions that address actual proven causes. They may be summarised as dysfunctional human behaviours that include:
# Owner age
# Choosing breeds with mental and physical needs that are ignored or unable to be met by owners life-style
# The presence of aggression, uncertainty and instability in the owners human environment
# Use of aggressive training techniques (P+/punishment or R-/deprivation of reward)
# Inadequate socialisation, training and recreational opportunities, 
# Hormonal levels
# Management history 
# Victim provocation (especially male children).

# Making it an offence to interact with another persons dog without explicit permission from the owner

# Require any person interacting with a dog to conduct themselves consistent with scientific knowledge and best practise while doing so. 

# Provide dog owners with maximum support to meet physical and psychological needs by 
-	Determining the exercise and recreational needs of local dog populations and providing suitable areas. 
-	Increase the number dog-specific off-leash areas, exclude traffic, and require children to be kept under close control. Require dogs to be properly socialised, under effective control and vaccinated before entering dog-specific facilities.
-	Provide dog-specific areas designed to satisfy dogs mental stimulation needs by providing space and facilities for uninterrupted training and play.

												Law-abiding owners meeting their welfare obligations avoid the actual contributing factors and are not responsible for responsible for taking action against law-breaking owners. That is the responsibility of government. 

Aggression is context-specific and there is no justification for requiring all dogs to be leashed and muzzled in public. That also prevent dogs exhibiting normal patterns of behaviour and places owners in breach of their Animal Welfare Act obligations. 

The requirement to fence was rejected as excessive when proposed in relation to dangerous dogs in 2003 and there is no evidence dogs that wander are also dogs that attack. There is no justification for extending that excess to all dogs. 

All options ignore victim behaviour and none address the real contributing factors identified above. 

However owners can be assisted by at least:
# Taking action against people who inappropriately interfere with dogs in public without the explicit permission of the owner.
# Requiring dogs and children to display best practise behaviour in dog specific areas such as dog parks.
# Regulating the dog training industry to ensure consistent and appropriate levels of advice.
# Display best-practise educational materials targeted at both non-dog owners and dog-owners in areas routinely used by dogs.

												Local government controls the means to those obligations such as access to public spaces and choosing whether to enforce the ability to impose more prescriptive rules. An analysis of the policy and bylaws of all South Island local authorities disclosed only three that explicitly recognise welfare obligations and only one explicitly stated the intention to enforce those standards. 

Most LGA’s dealt with increased aggression by increasing restrictions, primarily by reducing off-public areas and setting welfare standards lower than those legislatively prescribed. All have failed to work in the past. 

The single Council to take an animal welfare approach and focus on providing the means for owners to meet dogs physical and psychological needs has observed an immediate and significant reduction in all identified dog control “issues”, including aggression. 

That indicates Councils can very easily reduce dog attacks and other control issues by ceasing to pursue an increasingly restrictive and prohibitive approach that is proven not to work, and instead implementing a welfare based approach consistent with central government intentions based on current scientific knowledge and accepted best practise management.

												This can only come about by a culture change in the Animal Control departments. CURRENTLY it is obvious that there is too much focus on ENFORCEMENT and virtually none or very little on EDUCATION. We ALL recognise that the current system is not working. Currently we are embarrassed with the present culture of Animal Control and the mentality of most Animal Control Officers that seem to adopt more bully tactics focusing on enforcing and infringing and with more often than not a focus of killing the problematic dog. This is in place of education and training the dog owner. They seem to think that by eradicating the problematic dog ,that fixes the problem. In fact, we believe that this mentality and action has a negative effect as it is generally these dog owners who go straight out and replace those dogs and then you are back to square one! The result being, is that you not only have an uneducated dog owner but you have also now alienated them against the ACO’s . These are the very people that the ACO’s should be having a rapport with and working along side.

												The nub of the dog attacks issue IS dog owner responsibility but to achieve this requires PROPER EDUCATION AND TRAINING ! And this can only come about by a culture change in the Animal Control departments. CURRENTLY it is obvious that there is too much focus on ENFORCEMENT and virtually none or very little on EDUCATION.
we also strongly believe that a free desexing programme for everyone would make huge inroads - even if it only for 4-5 years - minimising the strays roaming and minimising cross breeding. We believe that this would also be saving the rate payers lots of money instead of it being spent employing Animal Control to constantly spend valuable time on stray, roaming dogs. We are regularly asked by members of the public if there is such a service for free desexing that still exists - and when it will be available. We have no doubt whatsoever that this would decrease the number of strays and in doing so reduce dog attacks. EDUCATION in schools is also essential. This should be carried out by an ACO that can connect with people, have good communication skills, P.R skills. It is apparent that this is lacking in the current ACO culture.

											<h4>
												Do you have any further suggestions to reduce the risk and harm of dog attacks?

												We also advocate that there needs to be change in their classification method - a dog should be classified on their DEED not their BREED. Why should a vicious lab not be classified on its breed when a lovely natured pitiful is automatically classified that shows no aggression? IN SUMMARY the following is our proactive changes to get a safer community- 
Change Personnel in Animal Control throughout NZ- leads to change in Animal Control culture -
Education !-
Free desexing-
Reducing amount of ‘unwanted’ dogs-
Increased good dog behaviour - leads to-
Reduction in dog attacks
Change of classification - DEED NOT BREED
 My husband and I would be certainly interested in a trial or pilot programme, if it was funded. We believe that we are geographically situated ideally to cover two cities effectively covering two city Councils and are a part of NZ where there is a perfect environment for such a programme.  We genuinely believe that we could get positive results in this area. Usually these vulnerable and low socio economic people cannot afford the impound fee, infringement or prosecution costs so loose their dogs which usually result in the dog being euthanised. These dog owners then simply replace the dog with another- starting the cycle again. Excuse the pun but we are  ‘just chasing our tails’ .

												There should be funding or programmes available for people to afford the training or education programmes. Another important point is the need to SOCIALISE a dog. We believe that this is the major key to having a non aggressive dog. We have seen the affect of this hard line culture on the public and pets often resulting in:

dog owners too scared to ‘socialise’ their dog - even on a lead- as they are afraid that if their dog misbehaves (through lack of education)  they may end up under the subject of an unreasonable, intimidating ACO that treats them unjustly potentially ending up loosing their dog. This discourages socialising which is an essential part of dog behaviour. 
an unfavourable response from dog owners towards the Animal Control Officers (especially if their beloved dogs have been euthanised in past history), causing at times dog owners lashing out with retaliation and non compliance. 
Individuals from a low socio economic group, feel even less encouraged to approach the officers for advice or education e.g if one had a dog that was nipping the family members, he may be fearful that his dog would be seized if he approached the ACO’s for advise for help

												We believe that a 'Nationwide job description with specific attributes for an Animal Control Officer' are essential to obtain a consistent, educational, approachable culture throughout NZ.  We believe that future employment selection should be focused on empathy and compassion, the ability to also work under considerable confrontation, have dog training knowledge or experience (or a desire to be taught and are teachable). We also believe that enforcement experience is desirable but not essential . We consider that dog control staff should have the ability to have a holistic approach to all pet ownership and to all situations they are faced with. This is essential in order to also identify the areas required for EDUCATION. To be proactive the ACO needs to engage in EDUCATING the dog owner on dog training techniques, how to deal with aggression and how to positively re-establish the order of leadership in the family WITH the dog - and so change the dogs behaviour.  The ACO can also provide them with information or links to reinforcing “how to teach your dog to see YOU as the pack leader” and the necessity for socialisation your dog with people and other dogs.

												The question that we are either faced with or we see on public comments is - “you should not have a dog if you cannot afford one” . We find this attitude narrow minded as firstly in this unstable, changeable economic climate that we are in - we ALL  not secure in our financial situation. Secondly the fact is - it is a FACT that people love dogs and desire to have dogs and so will have dogs - whether they can or cannot afford it. We or government cannot control this. So with this in mind, we need to then target the group of individuals that are most vulnerable to dog attacks-  as it is them that as records show, have the highest percentage of dog bites/ attacks. leglisation needs to be changed in the view that the dog owner has more rights to education and advice in a secure setting. Also that there is more funding or access to dog training/ behaviour education for dog owners that cannot afford the dog obedience classes. The word 'discernment' should also be able to be excerised where appropriate. Alot of enforcing is done when it is not even been the Dog owners fault.
