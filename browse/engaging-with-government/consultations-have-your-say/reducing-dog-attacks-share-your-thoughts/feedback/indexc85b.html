											<h4>
												What do you think is the biggest contributing factor to a dog attack?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Dog owner
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Please explain why this is the biggest contributing factor:
											</h4>
											<div>
												There is no ‘single biggest contributing factor’ to dog bite incidents. ALL dogs have the potential to bite. Many studies have shown that the tendency of a dog to bite is multifactorial and associated with at least five interacting factors: the individual dog’s genetic makeup; socialisation; training experiences (especially during sensitive periods of development); physical and psychological health; and the context of the incident including the behaviour of the victim and handler.  The degree to which any one factor influences the behaviour of a dog varies in each unique incident.
Regardless, it is a dog owner’s responsibility to safely control their dog. The evidence shows that dog owner behaviour often contributes to dog bite incidents because dogs that are not properly socialised, trained and contained are frequently involved in these incidents. Dog owners and non-dog owners need to be educated about dog behaviour and body language, and appropriate ways to interact with dogs. 
Previous analysis of bite statistics by breed type are likely inaccurate, due to inherent problems associated with reliance on visual identification of the dog breed. Multiple studies have now shown that accurate and reliable visual identification of the predominant breed in mixed breed dogs is not possible.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												If you selected 'Other' as the best way to reduce dog attacks, please explain.
											</h4>
											<div>
												A comprehensive education programme that uses appropriate training positive methods is needed. Negative training methods are associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems in dogs, including aggression. There should be a centrally maintained list of reputable dog trainers who use positive training methods.
Current breed specific legislation should be repealed so that there can be a greater focus on the adequate and proper of enforcement of dog control laws. ALL dogs have the potential to bite. Effective regulations need proper funding and should provide incentives for responsible dog owners, whilst ensuring there are adequate penalties and enforcement if dog owners act irresponsibly. 
Initiatives that have been successful at reducing dog attacks in other countries included a combination of incentives and penalties. For example, Calgary, Canada, successfully reduced dog bite incidents by investing in education for dog owners and children, and increasing penalties for owners in breach of registration regulations and owners of dogs that have bitten.
Oregon, USA, also implemented a model that reduced repeat biting incidents. This focused on the early identification of potentially dangerous dogs by implementing a “potentially dangerous dog” classification system based on significant factors in the dog’s life, not the breed of the dog.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you have any further suggestions to reduce the risk and harm of dog attacks?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Licencing owners and dog breeders provides the opportunity to control the serial ownership, breeding and dispersal of dogs that have the characteristics and experiences associated with an increased risk of biting. 
Owner licencing incorporating appropriate owner education and dog training would provide support for responsible dog owners, whilst still allowing an enforcement framework for non-compliant dog owners. 
All people who want to breed dogs should need to obtain a licence and adhere to guidelines which require responsible breeding practices (these should include selection of appropriate and non-aggressive dogs for breeding, provision adequate and appropriate care and facilities to protect the physical and behavioural wellbeing of the dogs/puppies, including adequate and appropriate socialisation of puppies and their parents).
A regulatory framework that restricts the breeding of dogs to licenced breeders only, subject to breeder guidelines and standards, can be utilised to reduce aggression and has the potential to reduce the number of unwanted animals and consequently the number of free-roaming dogs.
All establishments that sell or rehome dogs and puppies should be licenced with a requirement to desex dogs/puppies prior to sale and provide appropriate socialisation to meet the age appropriate behavioural and physical needs of the animal.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												If you selected 'Other', please explain how dog owners can reduce attacks.
											</h4>
											<div>
												All dogs should be desexed unless their owner has obtained a breeding licence.  Entire dogs are more likely to bite than desexed dogs. 
Adequate and appropriate socialisation of puppies is vitally important, especially during between 3 -12 weeks of age. This is the joint responsibility of breeders and owners. Safe and positive experiences during this critical period reduce the incidence of behavioural problems, including aggression.
Owners should obtain their dog/puppy from a reputable source where the behavioural appropriateness of the parents and/or dog could be evaluated and early socialisation and environmental needs were provided. 
Owners should improve their knowledge and understanding of dog behaviour. Appropriate socialisation, training and exercise are important to reduce behavioural problems, including aggression. 
Owners should seek early support from a reputable professional who uses positive training for behavioural problems, particularly aggression. Dogs implicated in serious attacks are more likely to have previously exhibited behavioural problems. 
Owners should identify and manage situations that potentially pose a bite risk including supervising interactions between children and dogs, not routinely chaining dogs (chained dogs are more likely to bite than unchained dogs) and early identification and treatment of injury/illness (dogs that are in pain are more likely to bite).

											<h4>
												If you selected 'Other', please explain how councils can reduce attacks.
											</h4>
											<div>
												Current breed specific legislation should be repealed to allow greater focus on adequate and proper enforcement of dog control laws. Adequate funding is needed for enforcing effective regulations and public education, especially for children. The majority of reported dog victims are children under the age of 15.  
Councils should inspect the properties of all dog owners (for initial registrations/address changes) to allow early identification of problems posing a potential risk for dog bite incidents (e.g. chaining dogs or inadequate fencing) and provide owner education about dog bite prevention. 
A consistent approach is needed for dog bite incident investigation, categorisation, recording and handling according to the incident’s severity and circumstances. 
Councils should provide incentives and support for compliance and responsible dog ownership, to balance non-compliance penalties. This also provides an opportunity to enhance their public image.
Councils should require all establishments that sell/rehome animals to require all dogs/puppies to be desexed prior to sale unless to a register breeder. Entire dogs are more likely to bite than de-sexed dogs. 
All establishments that sell/rehome animals should provide adequate and age-appropriate socialisation for dogs/puppies. Deficits in socialisation during sensitive periods of development are associated with increased risk of behavioural problems, including aggression.

											</h4>
											<div>
												Implement a coordinated national evidence-based education programme about dog behaviour, bite prevention and responsible dog ownership.  
Ensure consistency of bite prevention and responsible dog ownership messages from all levels of government.
Implement a national dog bite incident database, with mandatory reporting. Dog details would need to be recorded descriptively as visual identification through breed type alone is inaccurate.
Remove breed specific legislation (BSL).  BSL has never been shown to be effective, is not supported by current scientific evidence and diverts resources away from effective strategies such as education, training, desexing campaigns and registration enforcement. BSL does not reduce public risk and is likely to create even more risk of harm from dogs, due to the incorrect belief that dogs other than those that have been banned are ‘safe’. 
Implement a regulatory framework requiring all people who want to breed dogs to obtain a licence.
Require that all dogs and puppies are desexed prior to sale/transfer of ownership or release back to their owner after impoundment. 
Require that all establishments that sell/rehome animals provide adequate and age-appropriate socialisation for dogs/puppies. Deficits in socialisation during sensitive periods of development are associated with increased risk of behavioural problems, including aggression.

												Please explain why this is the biggest contributing factor:
											</h4>
											<div>
												While the tendency of a dog to bite depends on multiple factors, dog owners need to identify and manage situations that have the potential to pose a risk of a dog bite, and safely control their dog.

Dogs who are not properly trained, socialised and contained are often involved in dog bite incidents, so responsible dog ownership would reduce this risk - including desexing dogs, properly socialising and training dogs using positive reinforcement, supervising dogs with children, early identification and treatment of illness and injury, and not routinely chaining dogs.

However, dog owners and non-dog owners should be educated about dog behaviour and body language, and appropriate ways to interact with dogs to avoid dog bites.

Breed specific legislation has proven to be ineffective overseas - I do not believe this is a contributing factor to dog attacks.

											</h4>
											<div>
												Dog obedience classes would be a good way to reduce dog bites, as long as the methods used utilised positive reinforcement methods.  Negative, punishment-based training methods are associated with an increased risk of behaviour problems in dogs, including aggression, so this would not provide any benefits to the community.

Education for people of all ages, whether they own a dog or not, would be the best way to reduce dog bites.

Removing breed specific legislation would also stop people from assuming that they were safe around breeds that aren't banned. Any dog has the potential to bite, so it is important that people behave appropriately around all dogs.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you have any further suggestions to reduce the risk and harm of dog attacks?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Licensing dog owners and appropriate education and dog training would provide support for responsible dog owners. Enforcing penalties for non-compliant dog owners would also encourage responsible ownership.

Mandatory desexing for all non-breeders would also reduce aggression in dogs.

												Owners should ensure that their dog has been adequately socialised.
This is the joint responsibility of breeders and owners and helps to reduce the incidence of behavioural problems, including aggression.

Owners should also be educated on seeking early professional support to aid in behavioural problems, particularly aggression.

A requirement to muzzle dogs when in public would be ineffective and an unreasonable imposition on responsible dog owners. This could also compromise the welfare and wellbeing of a dog by restricting their ability to play and interact with other dogs and humans.

												Councils already have plenty of power and rules about what we can do with our dogs, they just don't seem interested in enforcing them.  I find it frustrating as a responsible owner of three dogs (all registered, obedience trained and on leash) to see dogs running around that aren't licenced or are of breeds that should be muzzled and desexed and are not.  There is no point in increasing the rules if the existing ones are not enforced.

												People may not know how to approach a dog and startle it.  Owners don't know how of don't take time to socialise their dogs, and/or don't correctly recognise the signals from their dog.  Some people mistake an 'attack' and don't realise that dogs often exhibit dominancy behaviours when interacting with other dogs.  Some people are simply fearful of all dogs, with or without a basis for that fear.

												Without proper regards to educating the public about dog behaviour; why dogs attack, body language, how to approach a dog, take care of a dog, (not meaining that owners have a imperative to have lessons, but that the general public should be given advice from animal behaviour proffessionals); help others -such as children- encounter stray dogs,  this can lead to mistreatment of this animal; which in turn can lead to unneccessary violence or unwanted behaviour with owners or pedestrians. Dog size, breed and control laws are merely just factors that induce a stronger or lesser attack, but legitimately educating the public about dog behaviour is more than enough to less frequent and even less alarming attacks in New Zealand.
