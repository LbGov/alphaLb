											<h4>
												Please explain why this is the biggest contributing factor:
											</h4>
											<div>
												Not only do the people who choose to own a dog need to be educated about how to properly care for, train and read your dogs behavior, but the public, especially children, need the knowledge of how to be safe and safely act around dogs. The owner has the responsibility to provide adequate training for the dog, especially if the dog will be in public situations such as beaches. However from experience, a child as well as other adults, need to learn how to approach and safely act around a dog.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you have any further suggestions to reduce the risk and harm of dog attacks?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Better education is a must for dog owners and children especially. Dog owners need to be responsible, maybe for every dog adopted or purchased, it could be compulsory to attend a training course, and if not completed you cannot own the dog. Being a dog owner who loves animals, I think it is up to the owner to provide the necessary training for the dog and if they don't have that skill, then they need to be educated before owning a dog.

											<h4>
												Please explain why this is the biggest contributing factor:
											</h4>
											<div>
												I think dog owners and parents/the other party are big factors too, but ultimately the thing that is going to allow an accident to occur is the lack of education of either/both parties. If both know how to deal with a growling dog, and recognise that as a warning and that the dog is uncomfortable but doesn't WANT to attack, they will not carry out behaviour that pushes the dog over the brink and makes it think its only option is to attack. A dog that feels threatened will try to protect itself, but giving a warning is actually a helpful thing and people should be able to recognise that it does not have to be a precursor to an attack, but rather the thing that helps you avoid one.

												In punishing owners, I think serious consideration should be given to how this impacts the dog, as I don't believe the dog should be held accountable. Punishment shouldn't necessarily be in the form of fines, perhaps mandatory obedience/training classes instead.

												Have more designated areas around Auckland for "dogs and dog owners only" -  no kids or non dog owners allowed in these areas. There would be big signs all around stipulating this
Also can have areas within these zones for "small dogs only" and the rest for "medium to big dogs only". That way the small dog owners can RELAX !  Small dog owners tend to get more stressed out !!!
Then of course the "parks for humans" would be humans only and signs can go up stipulating this in these areas

												With the exception of muzzling in public, all of the above. Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) does not reduce dog bites. BSL involves targeting and banning certain dog breeds, and evidence shows that it is not effective. Wherever BSL has been implemented, it has not been shown to reduce public risk and is likely to create even more risk of harm from dogs, due to the incorrect belief that dogs other than those that have been banned are ‘safe’.
