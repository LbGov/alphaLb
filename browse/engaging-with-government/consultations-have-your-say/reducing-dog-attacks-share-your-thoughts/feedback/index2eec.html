												Education about dog behaviour
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Please explain why this is the biggest contributing factor:
											</h4>
											<div>
												If you can read when a dogs behavior is changing you can preempt your behavior and help reduce the chance of being attacked. All animals will give a way of warning others that they are going to attack. If we want to co-exist with dogs we need to take responsibility and learn what these are. I feel in most cases this is possible. Blaming an animal that isn't by nature aggressive, and removing them from their family (worst still killing them) because a person or persons in their care hasn't learnt to read the signs is unacceptable. I feel this happens all to regularly. There are more attacks from small dogs than from larger breeds but people tend not to report these incidents. All dogs can attack for many reasons so reading the signs of when this might occur is a big start of reducing the number.  Dog owner responsibility would come in second.

												Not every dog owner is responsible in the way they handle their dogs. I have seen scary looking dogs running around freely on a reserve right in front of a primary school with no owner in sight. This made me feel quite nervous, and I think a few children trying to get to school too.

											<div>
												This issue is highly complex with a large number of contributing factors, to single out one over others is far too simplistic. Contributing factors include the genetics, early rearing experience, health, and training of the dog, the owner’s attitudes, experience and reasons for owning a dog, the situations surrounding each attack, including the victim’s behavior, and society’s tolerance of what constitutes normal dog behaviour.

												Given these multiple factors, it is clearly not just a dog problem. Any meaningful solution will require planned responses delivered across a wide range of agencies. These include local and central government, animal control personnel, the veterinary profession, the medical profession, dog trainers and behaviorists, educators, dog breeders, and dog welfare agencies.

											<div>
												The NZVA has developed a comprehensive position statement on the dangerous dog issue that involves a revised dog classification system, owner licensing, breeder registration, education, control of unwanted dogs and further empowering of dog enforcement authorities. We would welcome an opportunity to discuss this further with you.

											<div>
												Dog owners must assume responsibility for their dog(s), this includes providing for their needs, socializing and training them to reduce aggression, selecting a type of dog that suits their circumstances. Muzzling may be required if a dog is not trustworthy and ensuring they have control over the dog both when it is on and off the lead. They must also ensure that a dog that is unfriendly to visitors is securely confined and unable to escape.

											</h4>
											<div>
												Councils should clearly outline what constitutes responsible dog ownership, and educate owners on their responsibilities. Responsible dog ownership should be supported with significant incentives within the registration system that encourages ongoing dog training, effective containment, microchipping and de-sexing.
The aim of reducing dog attacks is compromised however, while a large pool of unregistered dogs exists.
Dog control officers should be resourced to patrol and actively target these dogs, with penalties for an unregistered dog offense being applied to their full extent.

											<div>
												The existing classifications of “menacing” and “dangerous” do not adequately support successful dog control in New Zealand. 

Specifically,  the automatic menacing classification given to dogs based on their breed. This is a gross oversimplification of the issue and fails to capture large numbers of potentially dangerous dogs that belong to other breeds or are crossbreds. It does not address or promote responsible dog ownership, and wastes resources by unnecessarily restricting both docile members of targeted breeds (Collier, 2006), and dogs that are not menacing but are classified as such simply on the ‘visual assessment’ of their breed.

Under current legislation, dogs can also be classified as dangerous based on behaviour that ranges from “showing aggressive behaviour” through to being involved in a fatal attack. Once classified as dangerous this endures for the rest of the dog’s existence. We believe that the failure to take into account the context of aggressive behaviour hinders the ability of the legislation to effectively address dog aggression problems.  
 
A multi-tier classification system based on dog behaviour and not breed must be adopted to address the issues above. This system would also allow for consideration of the context in which the behaviour occurred, and support earlier identification of potentially dangerous dogs. If breed is to be used as criteria for classification, owners of dogs classified based on breed, must have recourse to having their dogs behavior assessed to determine if they are menacing or not.  

A revised classification system for dogs should also make provision for behavior testing by an independent authorised person to provide further integrity to the system. This will serve to reduce expenses associated with objections, and guard against unjustified euthanasia. 

Any classification system adopted should contain a rehabilitation pathway that involves training and behavior testing for adult dogs exhibiting less serious behaviours, to allow for the classification to be rescinded. This rehabilitation should be mandatory and at the expense of the owner.

The legislative framework proposed by the Australian Veterinary Association is put forward as an example of the legislative framework.  (Australian Veterinary Association Ltd, 2012). 

Dog ownership is a privilege and not a right, and in order to support this, owner licensing should be implemented through an amendment to the Dog Control Act (1996). The aim of licensing is to ensure all owners who obtain a dog are aware of the dog’s needs and the responsibilities associated with dog ownership.

Obtaining a license would require attending an educational seminar on dog ownership and responsibilities and passing a test based on the course material. All dog license holders would receive education on their responsibility to use whatever appropriate methods of restraint are available to ensure public safety at all times for example leads, muzzles and fencing. Existing owners of dogs older than two years of age, with no dog related incidents on their record would automatically be grandfathered into the scheme. 

Penalties for owners of dogs that are involved in serious attacks could include loss of their dog license, as well as being fined and/or imprisoned as the law allows. Individuals who obtain a dog without a license should be fined, and the dog removed if a license cannot be obtained.

While individuals may resent an increased hurdle to dog ownership, we believe that this will be mitigated by the significantly reduced public risk by promoting responsible attitudes towards dog ownership. Licensing owners will serve the wider community by reducing the personal and financial costs associated with dog aggression.

Endorsements for classified dogs

All owners of dogs that are classified as dangerous or menacing would be required to obtain an endorsement to their license that allows them to own a classified dog. The endorsement would require that owners are tested for their mental and physical abilities to handle the dog safely, be subject to a criminal background check, have the support from residents in the house, and have facilities which allow such a dog to be restrained at home and not be a danger to visitors. The dog should also be subject to behaviour testing and retraining. 

The endorsement would not be available to minors. If an endorsement is not obtained, or if the dog fails behavior testing then the classified dog should be surrendered.

Dog population management

Breeding Permits

To successfully address dangerous dog issues, the unwanted dog population must also be managed. It is essential that dogs are not easily replaced by a new puppy if they are removed under this legislation. 

Owners of dogs capable of breeding should be required to hold a specific permit issued by the territorial authority. Exemptions could be made if the dog owner was a member of a breeding organisation that required its members to operate in accordance with a code of ethics.

This recommendation is based on the observation that countries that rigorously apply breeding and ownership licensing, such as Switzerland and Sweden, do not have shelters that are overflowing in unwanted dogs. By limiting the supply of dogs, these countries have fostered an attitude where dogs are seen as “part of the family”, resulting in low abandonment rates (Tasker, 2007).

												Dog breed and dog owners are BIG factors, especially when they're mixed. People who are unfit to own dogs, own aggressive breeds which result in no control and innocent members of the community are affected. Government needs control on who owns dogs, who breeds dogs and who these breeds are sold to. Everyone should be analysed to ensure they are a fit dog owner, and put their dog through an aggression test.

												Dogs are animals and all animals revert to instinct when they are frightened or cornered.  I have seen many children run up to dogs - small and large and put their faces right into theirs while the dog is trying to back away and owners saying "come on Fido, be friendly!"  Makes me shiver.  They don't knowhow to properly read dogs’ body language, proper approach - educating children and the public about how to safely interact with dogs and prevent bite incidents is particularly important.
