												Vinyl is often printed off shore. Personally my label is Japanese and sells better worldwide than in New Zealand. At present I don't make money off vinyl it is more a way to collaborate, learn and get my name out internationally. often work becomes collectable and worth a lot long after it was pressed, I have some New Zealand written and produced records that are worth about $900 dollars each. Vinyl lasts along time if looked after and the artwork encapsulates something that digital cannot. It's the most important physical representation of music we have.

												Simply distributors could easily add vinyl to what is provided to our archives, this makes sense. hard/ physical copies are invaluablealongside digital and vinyl is the longest lasting we have.

												I would advocate no change to the current situation, or perhaps a change to require that digital copies of the content of the records be submitted in place of physical copies.
My own record label specialises in very limited edition LATHE CUT releases, typically between 20 and 40 copies that are presented in a way more reminiscent of a numbered art print than a regular music release. All the covers are handmade and even occasionally hand painted. A requirement to provide 2 free copies of these artefacts would unnecessarily add significantly to the cost I would therefore have to charge those who buy them.
NZ has a great many small scale artists who utilise the stellar lathe cutting services of Peter Kings cutting plant in My Somers. I actually work part time for Peter doing digital stuff and know that the majority of orders he cuts are also between 20 and 40 copies.
In cases such as this- as opposed to the PRESSED edtions from overseas that are typically greater than 200 copies- would it not be adequate to have a digital rather than physical copy of the record.
I also have a music career of sorts myself and have had vinyl records released on overseas labels in editions of 200-500 copies. The standard terms with these labels is that I receive between 10 and 15% of the run. Again I myself wind up with very few copies and providing 2 free copies to the library would significantly reduce the potential income I could get from said release.

												6. If you consider there are specific additional or modified terms and conditions that pertain uniquely to vinyl records, please list these and explain why you consider them necessary.
											</h4>
											<div>
												When a label or artist has less than 100 records at their disposal then a digital copy of the album should be sufficient (or else it should be paid for by the library).

When the album in question has unique and handmade packaging for each copy then a digital copy of the album should be sufficient (or else it should be paid for by the library).
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												8. If you have any other comments you’d like to make, please add them here.
											</h4>
											<div>
												I am a member of an unofficial artistic network where in the production of music records is more akin to fine arts practice than the regular music industry. Whilst we are only a small part of the greater music community in NZ we would still number in the low 100s. I am a great believer in the National Library and its work but I believe that the changes being mooted here would add a disproportionate burden to myself and others working with very small edition sizes and/or limited copy editions that are of a 'fine art' nature.

												Vinyl is an important music format which needs to be preserved.
There are a large number of vinyl collectors of NZ recording - including myself - whose collections could be made use of.
Vinyl is a historic format which is dying out.

												Regard needs to be given to (1) short run pressings (say <100 units) (2) cut poly-carbonate lathe-cut acetates, (3) lathe-cut (not pressed) vinyl 'dub-plates' which may only be made in quantities of 1-50 and arrangements between local label and/or artists in which a small portion (< 100 units) of a pressing is available to them in NZ. Requiring 1-2 copies of a release w/o payment in these circumstances could be an unreasonable demand, given the cost per unit of some of these.

											<h4>
												6. If you consider there are specific additional or modified terms and conditions that pertain uniquely to vinyl records, please list these and explain why you consider them necessary.
											</h4>
											<div>
												Given the variables above of limited quantity pressings, limited NZ label/ artist shares of international label release arrangements, polycarbonate acetate lathe cuts, lathe-cut vinyl dub-plates and the cost-per-unit for some of these low quantity reproduction methods (typically at least $50 per lathe-cut vinyl dub-plate) it would be unreasonable to make a legal requirement for these to be supplied without cost. 

Solutions are to either exempt small-run/ high cost releases like these from the scheme (music can be provided on another format, usually digital, sometimes CD) or to pay the full cost. 

The requirement to archive items should be the content of the music release (music and related visual information) rather than the format within which the music is stored. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												8. If you have any other comments you’d like to make, please add them here.
											</h4>
											<div>
												Small quantity runs of vinyl/ analog releases are predominantly made or released by niche interest artists, and the economics involved are usually, at best, recovering the manufacture costs. Compulsory statutory Government acquisition without compensation of copies of small run releases is not a reasonable approach, particularly when the works can be archived in other formats, usually digital.

												We believe that the intent of the legislation is to collect all creative output for New Zealand.  Many emerging musicians are producing works on vinyl and digital only, excluding other physical formats. These must be collected for future enjoyment and research. As a large public library with o focus on our region's creative output, we hope that National Library would be ensuring the nation's creative output is collected and preserved.

												While it is important to recognise our rich / diverse New Zealand recording history and to archive and protect it for future generations there a wide range of economic variables  when it comes to the release of vinyl records here in New Zealand, not only for niche / boutique recording artists and labels, but the wider recording industry in NZ.  

The production and manufacture of vinyl is significantly higher than the production of other forms of physical media. Surveying our membership, which ranges from small independent record labels and self-releasing recording artists (in some instances producing vinyl runs of less than 50 copies) all the way to larger record companies, the production of vinyl can be categorised as a very premium product and made purposefully in limited quantities.

With this in mind Recorded Music NZ would strongly recommend that compensation is made to producers and at the very least wholesale level when requested under legal deposit.

												Ideally we believe a copy of all vinyl/analog recordings should be submitted to legal deposit. However, there is significant cost to producing limited edition vinyl. Where a recording is produced as part of a limited edition run (for example less than 20) or has hand produced cover art we feel that a digital impression should be adequate.

											<div>
												We support the inclusion of vinyl in legal deposit. It provides an important cultural record, and the cover art and notes contribute as much to that record as the sound recording.
