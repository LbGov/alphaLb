<p>* Transparency. There is obvious scope to build on the Ombudsman and Law Commission's work reviewing the OIA, as well as some easy to implement but highly ambitious options which could be pursued (e.g. Cabinet transparency, with automatic release of Cabinet papers and minutes) * Anti-corruption: this ties into the reaction to the Panama papers. Other countries (e.g. the UK) have led on this, establishing public beneficial ownership and lobbying registers, and New Zealand should follow. * I am not interested in Open Data. The government choosing what to make open and what to keep secret is not true openness. * I oppose use of the OGP Action Plan to legitimise the Data Futures Forum / IDI / Social Investment Agenda. The mass data mining of the New Zealand public is not about open government, and has huge privacy implications. That's not what the OGP is about, and SSC should not use the OGP as a trojan horse for it.<b></b></p>

<p>By better incorporation and improving on the LINZ Open govt info and data program. I believe that LINZ has rightly previously focussed on open govt data however this programme needs to expand. There are significant and large holdings of other types of Crown copyright works that should be made openly available for reuse to the NZ tax payer - including peer reviewed research and research data currently behind publisher paywalls, artistic and literary works, sound recordings and film commissioned by government departments. Whomever is responsible for encouraging govt depts to adopt NZGOAL should be focussing on building a large bank of freely available and openly licenced works for reuse and promoting their availability via established aggregators link Digital NZ and Pond.<b></b></p>

<p>I strongly believe that all copyright works paid for by government funding should be freely and openly available for reuse by default. In practice this means I can access research papers written by DOC natural environment scientists without having to pay a publisher money to access a copy online. (I can’t). I can download in high resolution from Archives NZ all of the artworks commissioned by the Ministery of Education for the school journals for my niece to digitally remix for a school project or my friend who owns a printing business to print on t-shirts and sell (I can’t).

<p>My main area of interest is in the reuse of data obtained through Government and Government funded initiatives. I think NZ’s last National Action Plan could be improved by not only emphasising  the ability of citizens to identify, access, and engage with government data and information but also empowering citizens with the right to REUSE that data and information in any way they wish.<b></b></p>

<p>I look at open government through the lens of the reuse of that information. As a citizen not only do I want the Government to improve my ability to identify and access information and data, I want to have the right to reuse that data and information in any way I see fit. As  a practical example I put forward my citizen science activities. These include the editing of New Zealand species articles in Wikipedia to help other citizen scientists, such as those using the New Zealand Naturewatch website improve their identification of species. I am frequently frustrated by my inability to access government funded scientific research papers published in journals that put that research behind paywalls. I am also frustrated that I am unable to access such data as images created by the Department of Conservation. I would also like to have the ability to reuse images and research papers created by Crown Research Institutes such as Landcare Research, the imaging and digitisation of which is funded by my tax dollars.  Obviously this is a very specific example of reuse, but I also see this reuse theme being prevalent in such groups as GovtHack NZ.</p>

<p>Be more honest about our current state and shortcomings. For example the Introduction states that “Our governing system does not tolerate corruption.

We have a politically neutral public service designed to provide free and frank advice and deliver on the objectives of the Government of the day; and the Official Information Act is the platform around which citizens have a right to information and government has an obligation to provide it.”  I take issue with every one of these assertions.<b></b></p>

<p>Focus on developing new initiatives, especially in the area of participation.</p>
<p>The White House and US department’s OG plans were much more innovative and involved doing new things. New Zealand’s reads like</p>
<p>a. a re-hash of things the government was going anyway;</p>
<p>b. you don’t understand open government and think it’s just being democratic/uncorrupt; and</p>
<p>c. like you are focused on elites.</p>
<p>Most of the proposals are about techniques around communication of information and mostly in government and between government elites rather than government and non-government i.e. citizens.  Open government is not just about transparency or new technology.</p>
<p>The plan, and the comments on these pages, come across as false, and convey the sense that NZ has only the vaguest conception of open government, and really at heart does not understand what it is about. Yet NZ government has run some excellent, innovative participation exercises such as the Tax Working Group and Welfare Working Group that really effectively connected ministers and a range of groups in society. Yet none of that is mentioned, either in the action plan or in the pages on this website</p>
<p>We need to start taking this more seriously and give appropriate resources to new initiatives.</p>

<p>A major improvement would be either:</p>
<p>•               A written New Zealand Constitution; or</p>
<p>•               Primary Legislation defining our democracy, its operation and its principles (and by primary legislation, I mean an Act of Parliament that has been put to a referendum and enshrines that it can only be changed by a referendum recommended to the people of New Zealand by a majority of 75% or more of New Zealand’s House of Representatives).</p>
<p>A second major improvement would be:</p>
<p>•               To establish a standalone Education Body, responsible for education of the citizenship generally (through a variety of media), our primary school and our secondary school students. This body should be set up by statute, be provided adequate funding, and should be independent of our other educational entities. Its aim would be to provide learning on citizen participation (and how to go about it), citizen collaboration, transparency, accountability and the mechanisms and philosophy of our particular design of society in New Zealand.</p>
<p>A third improvement would be:</p>
<p>•               To establish a body that explores effective ways that government can engage with and consult with New Zealand’s citizens. The number of people who respond to this particular opportunity to provide input will, I am sure, be small in number compared with the New Zealand population of people 18 years of age and older. This body would have a goal of significantly increasing citizen engagement with initiatives such as this.</p>

<p>i) First and fundamentally, by starting from the right place – recognising that the OGP is NOT about the absolute levels of transparency, participation etc in each member country, it is about the DELTA, it is about improving where each country is, no matter what its starting point.</p>
<p>This was one of the core parts of the OGP mechanism that President Obama set up. It is why the other co-founder of the OGP (Brazil) was a ‘southern country’, to distinguish the OGP from many international ‘clubs’ where the advanced countries tell the rest what they need to do.  NZ got off on the wrong foot with a self-congratulatory approach based on trumpeting how transparent we already are and how wonderful Better Public Services is - without adding any additional ‘stretch’ beyond existing BPS policy, or consulting the public in a meaningful way on the Action Plan that reflected OGP principles. It then adopted a defensive approach when its Action Plan was not well-received. And the way this draft Introductory paper is written continues to reflect that failure to understand what the OGP is fundamentally about.</p>
<p>ii) By genuine consultation and co-creation. Genuine openness would mean that the paper refers to the IRM report on the first Action Plan, including its main findings and the five recommendations in it – which reflect consultation by the IRM researcher and which have formal status in the OGP process. To understand the fundamental importance of the independent review process in the OGP, and the importance of all countries respecting it and protecting it, look at Samantha Power’s speech to the OGP Summit in Mexico City last October (Power was one of the architects of the OGP). To leave reference to the NZ IRM report out of the section on ‘what we learned’ is presumably an oversight that can be quickly rectified.</p>
<p>iii) The discussion of the fact that NZ scores highly on a number of international indices needs to be balanced by including discussion of concerns outside government about the state of integrity, openness, accountability, and public participation in NZ. Amongst other documents, the 2013 TINZ NIS assessment should be cited, as it represented a large-scale civil society exercise, involving extensive research and civil society consultations and input, on topics that are at the heart of the OGP.  Some of those consulted on NZ’s OGP Action Plan have expressed support for it and the usefulness of its recommendations for developing NZ’s Action Plan e.g. the PSA said ‘the NIS assessment provides the greatest opportunity for new actions’.</p>

<p>A systematic and pro-active approach to greater direct and meaningful public engagement in the development of public policies, their implementation, monitoring and review. NZ scores well on a number of indices of transparency, but even the most transparent disclosure without public engagement does not necessarily lead to more accountability or better policies or improved outcomes. The latest generation of transparency and accountability initiatives – of which OGP is just one - are stressing direct public engagement (in combination with expanded disclosures), both as a democratic right of citizens, and for instrumental reasons i.e. public participation improves the quality, effectiveness and perhaps, most importantly, the legitimacy of public policies – witness the widespread public outcries in western democracies about the perceived unfairness of public policies, and about perceived capture of the public policy process by insiders and elites. Failure to address these concerns risks reducing the ability of NZ governments to govern effectively by being able to continue to draw on high levels of willingness to obey the law, pay taxes, comply with regulations, model ethical behaviour in their communities, volunteer, and to willingly provide social services under contracts with government that do not reflect the full costs.</p>
<p>Open government also means:</p>
<p>•               Increased transparency in key areas of weakness and concern, such as regular independent environmental and social reporting, political party funding, and lobbying of public officials.</p>
<p>•               More effective oversight of the executive by Parliament.</p>

<td width="612" valign="top">
<p>First theme: completing unfinished business from the first Action Plan i.e. responding properly to the 2013 TINZ NIS assessment and its 60 or so recommendations. Considering the NIS recommendations was a commitment in the first Action Plan, and there has been no published attempt by the government to demonstrate that this has occurred. To have credibility, the second plan needs to pick this commitment up, specify it properly in terms of OGP SMART criteria, and deal with it properly.</p>
<p>Secondly, the five recommendations in the IRM report have specific status in the OGP, and need to be given sufficient visibility as inputs into the process of developing the second action plan.</p>
<p>Thirdly, other suggested themes - many of which overlap with the IRM report’s recommendations – are:</p>
<p>a.             Official information Act: systematic pro-active disclosure; extend coverage to Parliamentary bodies; increase efforts to train public servants on their duties under the Act.</p>
<p>b.             Public engagement: a government-wide initiative to develop a pro-active, systematic and consistent approach to increased direct and meaningful public engagement with all communities, and especially traditionally unheard voices, across the policy cycle.</p>
<p>c.             Public service integrity: strengthened whistle blower laws and implementation; reinstatement of regular SSC surveys of public service conduct and integrity; a commitment to reviewing and protecting the role of non-partisan and free and frank advice by public servants to elected officials.</p>
<p>d.             Increased public disclosure: technically independent state of the nation social and environmental reporting; publish an annual Citizens’ Guide to the Budget and introduce further initiatives to raise citizen budget literacy; extend transparency of public procurement; and publish Ministers’ diaries.</p>

<p>Open government isn’t just about open data.  Open data and ICT are supplementary in decision-making processes.  Evidence is limited on how open data empowers ordinary citizens compared with the proactive release of information.</p>
<p>Also need to have open and proactively released information e.g. Cabinet and official papers.  Budget information could be presented much more accessibly for the public, including clarity about funding that is being moved between or within Votes each year.</p>

<p>Two things.  First, it means an honest conversation with people about policies that affect them.  It is NOT just about open data or e-government.  Nor is it about information sharing but listening, with proper structures in place to support that.  These need not be particularly hierarchical but they do need to exist.  Second, it also means being a bit more grown up about politics - lobbying; party funding; suspicions of patronage; trading in influence; etc.   Be more honest about who speaks to the government and what they talk about.  Its politics rather than policy that needs addressing - so make sure we put the ‘government’ back into open government.</p>

<p>Process issues - Abiding by the rules and guidance from the OGP website would help. For example there is a requirement that the independent interim review of the plan be published in NZ but this has not happened. Meeting notes have required OIAs to be released on more than 1 occasion but just recently these together with all of the documentation relating to the first iteration 2014-16 of the plan has been removed from the SSC website. This hardly seems transparent.</p>
<p>The consultation notification FOR THIS CURRENT ROUND has consisted of a single 1 line change to the SSC website’s OGP page which did not update the page updated date. This meant that the only option to track news would have been to visit the web-page daily. This does not inspire confidence. Only when the consultation opened did the www.govt.nz website contain a consultation listing.  At no point in the current process has there been notification  to the media of the process to be followed i.e even a press release either to announce the consultation or notification about the four month delay to the plan.</p>
<p>Content issues - Three of the four challenges chosen last time were not new, or even really about open government.  The fourth, the TINZ 2013 recommendations were never addressed in any meaningful, consistent way.</p>
<p>Committing to addressing these issues would be a minimum.<b></b></p>

<p>That the workings of government should always be freely available to the public. Also information in Parliament should be equally available to all MP's. It is ridiculous that 'the government' of the day should have access to information that is kept from 'opposition' parties. All of these MPs were voted in equally - in fact some opposition MPs will have received more votes than some government MPs - so they should all be of equal standing, as in local government.</p>

<p>Engagement with citizens. The political parties that provide our MPs no longer represent the bulk of our population. For people to feel they have some influence, they have to have opportunities to be involved in policy-making and decision making in areas of real importance eg superannuation. Governments need to respect, listen to and act on the ideas of their citizens. We already do this in the justice system, where a panel of citizens listens to all the experts and declares a verdict. It is then up to the judge to decide the sentence. This process is called sortition. It was used by the ancient Athenians but is also in practice in the modern world at different levels of administration as a better and more inclusive way of deciding issues. One of the examples I read about (easily available on the Internet) involved half politicians, half randomly chosen citizenry.</p>

<p>A respectful two-way relationship where government actively informs the public about the things it's doing in their name, listens to their opinions about it, and adapts its practice in response to their feedback. Democracy is the opposite of surveillance. In a democracy, people go about their personal business in private, watch the business of government taking place in public, and give their opinions on things that matter to them. In a surveillance state, people go about their personal business being watched by the government, and if they want to obtain information about or influence government, they're watched even more.</p>

This time we need to finalise a set of actions that are new and which together meet the four tenets of the Open Government Partnership - accountability, transparency, information and technology and participation. They will, therefore, involve confirming ongoing rules, regulations and mechanisms that call upon government actors to justify their actions, etc; providing citizens with open access to technology and skills to use them; mobilising citizens to engage in public debate to enable responsive, innovative and effective governance; and open, comprehensive, timely and freely available information on government activities and decisions released following open information standards.</p>
