				<h1>Open Government in New Zealand</h1>
				
			</div>

			



			<p>New Zealand remains a strong and resilient representative democracy. The New Zealand Government is regularly rated amongst the world's best for its openness and transparency and amongst the lowest on international corruption indexes. This reflects a fundamental culture of openness and transparency at the heart of our government.</p>
<p>We know that it takes attention and diligence to maintain and advance the principles of openness and transparency that are cornerstones of New Zealand's approach to government. In the 2017 <a href="https://rsf.org/en/ranking">World Press Freedom Index</a> New Zealand dropped eight places to 13th in the world and there have been recent concerns about <a href="http://www.ssc.govt.nz/final-report-investigation-allegations-against-former-cera-employees">conflicts of interest</a> and <a href="http://www.ssc.govt.nz/media-statement-ssc-investigation-whistle-blower-treatment-within-ministry-transport">whistleblowing</a> in the public sector. These concerns highlight areas where we can improve, as well as showing a system with checks and balances that work and a strong commitment to fairness and transparency.</p>
<p>The development of OGP action plans is one of the tools available to progress open government in New Zealand. However, the National Action Plan 2016-18 sits in a broader context of a focus on integrity, transparency, engagement and accountability.</p>
<p>To support openness and integrity in New Zealand's government system, the State Services Commission established a new Integrity, Ethics and Standards group on June 6. This group is focused on building greater trust and confidence in public services.</p>
<p>The OGP process encourages the priorities of New Zealanders to be understood by decision-makers in government. Participation in the OGP for New Zealand provides another avenue to develop and strengthen our democracy, alongside activities that are already under way. Examples of activities complementary to the National Action Plan 2016-18 are described below.</p>

<h2>Better Public Services</h2>
<p>Consistent with the OGP's goals of improving the quality of public services and the relationship between government and citizens, a major public sector reform work programme has been under way in the New Zealand public sector through the Better Public Services programme since 2012. The 36 chief executives of New Zealand's State services <sup><a id="ft1b" href="index.html#ft1f">1</a></sup> have agreed to work together as a team to reshape how the system delivers for New Zealanders. The chief executives have launched a collective multi-year work programme across six broad categories that will give pace and focus to improvements in:</p>
<ul>
<li>digital services</li>
<li>shared data and analytics</li>
<li>leadership development and diversity</li>
<li>trust and confidence in the Public Service</li>
<li>how the system can better organise itself to meet citizens' needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each work stream is led by a chief executive and is supported by a group of chief executives.</p>
<p>Better data and analytics will help government understand New Zealanders better. We'll get a clearer picture of where interventions and investment are needed and what difference we're making, at what pace. Our customers increasingly expect modern, user-friendly services to be accessible digitally.</p>
<p>To accomplish all of this, the Government needs to attract and retain talented people across the system. We need to look beyond single agencies to develop and deploy the right people for the right roles, wherever their skills are needed. We've also committed to driving our diversity and inclusion agenda, so that our people represent and understand the communities they serve.</p>
<p>Underpinning all these changes is work to maintain and build the trust, respect and integrity of the Public Service. This is the foundation of our ability to serve ministers and the public. This formalises the role of open government as a foundational pillar of a trusted, high-integrity, public service in New Zealand.</p>
<p>This work programme builds on the Better Public Services reforms of 2012, which sought to re-orientate the Public Service around the needs of customers, rather than the convenience of agencies. Part of that programme are the ten government stretch targets for:</p>
<ul>
<li>reducing long-term welfare dependency</li>
<li>supporting vulnerable children</li>
<li>boosting skills and employment</li>
<li>reducing crime, and</li>
<li>improving interaction with government.</li>
</ul>
<p>By 2017, the results had been achieved.</p>
<div>
<p>The ten results have since been updated, including some new areas of priority for collective actions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ssc.govt.nz/bps-snapshot">Ten results from the State Services Commission</a></p>
<h2>Crown-Māori partnership</h2>
<p>The New Zealand Government has a commitment to honour its <a href="http://www.treaty2u.govt.nz/the-treaty-up-close/treaty-of-waitangi/">Treaty of Waitangi</a> relationship with iwi Māori (indigenous Māori tribes) of New Zealand. For some iwi these relationships are enshrined in Treaty of Waitangi settlement legislation. In this respect some Treaty settlements commit the Government to meet annually with iwi to engage on key policy matters defined through the Treaty Settlement process.</p>
<p>The Government has also entered into a direct engagement process with the leaders of Māori tribes, the Iwi Leaders Group, and they often attend the <a href="http://iwichairs.maori.nz/">Iwi Chairs Forum</a> to share policy developments and gain feedback from the Iwi Leaders. The forum meets regularly to pursue Māori aspirations in the spheres of cultural, social, economic, environmental and political development. At the Iwi Chairs Forum at Waitangi on February 2017, 14 Ministers attended and the Prime Minister and other Cabinet Ministers directly addressed the Forum for two hours. Iwi Leaders were also given time to present their specific matters of interest.</p>
<p>From time to time where there are key policy issues confronting New Zealand, the Government will establish direct working groups with iwi Māori mainly through the Iwi Leaders Group, to provide strategic oversight and a mechanism of engagement. Currently the Government has direct engagements with the Iwi Leaders Group on:</p>
<ul>
<li>freshwater management</li>
<li><a href="https://www.tpk.govt.nz/whakamahia/whanau-ora">Whānau Ora</a><sup><a id="ft2b" href="index.html#ft2f">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Te Runanga Reo, which is working on revitalisation of te reo Māori ( Māori language)</li>
<li>the <a href="http://www.tehiku.iwi.nz/social-accord.html">Te Hiku social accord</a>, and</li>
<li>family violence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ministers engage directly with a set of nominated Iwi Leaders from the Iwi Leaders Group. Government officials then engage directly with iwi technical advisors to work through policy development.</p>
<h2>Civic participation</h2>
<p>The Office of Ethnic Communities of the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) works to increase active citizenship of people in ethnic communities to build social cohesion. Work under way includes encouraging and enabling civic participation (for example, voting, participating in local and central government processes and standing for election). The Department also <a href="https://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Resource-material-Our-Policy-Advice-Areas-Community-led-Development?OpenDocument">supports community-led development</a> more broadly by providing support, advice and funding.</p>
<p>The vibrancy of the community sector in New Zealand demonstrates <a href="http://www.stats.govt.nz/tools_and_services/a-z-information-releases/non-profit-institutions-satellite-account.aspx">healthy levels of civic participation</a>, with volunteers providing the equivalent of approximately $3.5 billion to the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Only 10 percent of non-profit organisations employ any staff; 90 percent are totally reliant on volunteers. More than a third of these volunteer hours are worked in culture and recreation non-profit organisations (mainly sports groups), followed by hours volunteered to religious bodies and social services. According to DIA information, 'informal' volunteering (outside of organisations), involves twice as many New Zealanders, giving more than twice as much of their time.</p>
<h2>Open local government</h2>
<p>The central Government focus on open and high-integrity government is further complemented by local government initiatives. For example, the <a href="http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/AboutCouncil/HaveYourSay/Pages/PeoplesPanel.aspx?utm_source=shorturl&amp;utm_medium=print&amp;utm_campaign=Peoples_Panel">Auckland Council's People's Panel</a> provides Aucklanders with a quick and easy way to get involved with the council's plans, activities and services. The Panel currently has more than 25,000 self-nominated subscribers from all walks of life, supporting efforts to get a diversity of comments and perspectives on important matters for New Zealand's largest city. Auckland Council is committed to ensuring its citizens have a strong voice and are key in shaping Auckland. The philosophy is that communities work best when they can influence the decisions that affect them, and can take an active role in shaping their future. As Auckland becomes increasingly super-diverse, that challenge increases but the Council is committed, via a dedicated cross-council work stream to ensuring all Aucklanders have a strong voice in Auckland's future and increasing trust in council to deliver it.</p>
<p>The Auckland Council has joined New Zealand's OGP Officials Group, enabling exchange of experiences and mutual learning on engagement and consultation between Auckland and central Government.</p>
<h2>Trans-Tasman Open Government collaboration</h2>
<p>On 17 February 2017 the Prime Minister of New Zealand, the Rt Hon Bill English and the Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP, issued a joint statement in which they agreed on the importance of public data in driving innovation, improving government services and transforming policy outcomes. They noted there is scope to build stronger cross-Tasman collaboration to facilitate knowledge sharing between the two countries and find new and innovative ways to use and disseminate public data. The two Prime Ministers agreed that Australia and New Zealand will collaborate on public data initiatives to better align agendas, share lessons learnt on best practice and work together on data commitments as part of the Open Government Partnership.</p>
<p>All the above activities can help expand the scope and reach of open government in New Zealand.</p>
