<p>The library itself probably can't/won't have enough leverage to have as big an impact as it could if it partnered. Together the partners could reach areas of society that could only be reached through a connected network. New Zealand is too small to NOT work together. The various orgs have different strengths and weaknesses, some overlaps in community, and no real reason NOT to work together. Much more could be achieved through a co-ordinated and shared effort. With a rapidly changing cultural face of the nation, one organisation is not going to be able to keep up with all the communities needs.<b></b></p>

<p>This draft strategy outlines some really important goals and ways to work towards them. The only thing I would add is that our increasingly digital world makes us increasingly connected internationally as well as nationally. It also widens the gaps between those that are and are not connected - and there are many within Aotearoa New Zealand who are not. Online, it doesn't matter to an individual accessing information whether that material is from NLNZ, another NZ source, or from anywhere else in the world. It may also not be clear whether the information is from a reliable source or authoritative or free to use. To address these issues, I encourage NLNZ to - include an international element to the strategic direction - add 'digital literacy' to the literacy and access goals for our next generation nation of readers.<b></b></p>

<p>At a general level the S2S Capability Services Team is supportive of the three themes. They represent the (actual and potential) role of the National Library in its broadest sense, incorporating people, collections (taonga), connections (access), story, and technology. They also provide a line of sight with the broader priorities of DIA, specifically in relation to building stronger communities, providing access to trusted information, and transformed service delivery. The themes and key terms do need to be defined specifically in order for them to become meaningful (that is, more than aspirational ‘catchy slogans’). For example ‘words’ – are these written words only? Spoken? English language only? ‘Taonga’ – what about the non-word based treasures in the collection? It would also be helpful if the integrated nature of the themes was more explicitly articulated. How do they reflect and support each other to really create an information and knowledge rich National Library that truly adds value to New Zealand?</p>

<p>Yes. The role of a National Library is to be more than simply a repository (whether digital or print). Collection items must be made accessible and available, supplemented by services to build literacy and knowledge in all New Zealanders, connecting them with their culture and heritage and contributing to a nation that is well-informed, understanding, and prosperous. The themes are also future-focused and broad enough to encompass valuable work in a variety of specific areas. For any ‘national’ library there is by definition a specific role related to nation-wide leadership. Generally the document aspires to this with broad priorities and initiatives, the desire to develop partnerships and work in collaboration with others (acknowledging complementary strengths), and an emphasis on systems.<b></b></p>

<p>Horizon 3: Exploration and Transformation is considered the most important due to its potential for providing New Zealanders with more equitable access to information and knowledge. As described currently however, the Horizon is focused on information infrastructure and products. It is missing crucial aspects related to people’s abilities (skills, competencies, mental models, and multiple literacies). We need to strengthen the ability of people to access, understand, evaluate and use vast amounts of information in multiple formats. Services to Schools have an important role in building this type of capability within the education, library and literacy sectors. It is the combination of human capability and technology that truly allows for the development of partnerships, connection and “exploration and transformation” at an individual, community, national and international level.<b></b></p>

<p>Horizon 1: Continuous Improvement is problematic mainly due to its lack of definition regarding ‘e-content’. If this term means ‘e-books’ then there are platform, copyright, and access issues that have thus far proved too complex to resolve in any general manner (particularly for schools). Horizon 2: Next Generation is theoretically positive but would be challenging to deliver. This is due to the lack of resourcing and capacity within the National Library to “deliver network solutions”, but also because of the initiative’s dependence on cooperation from such a diverse group of stakeholders. It may be difficult to get schools to engage in a shared library management system. This is due to resourcing and capacity issues as well as the ‘self-managing’ environment. Also any ‘school-friendly’ system would need a level of sophistication, enabling the integration of the NZ curriculum and individual teacher/school planning with collection items. Ideally the system should also integrate with accredited Student Management Systems. It is also important to remember that an integrated library management system on its own does not achieve equity. Capability and capacity issues in schools need to be considered and addressed in order to achieve this goal.<b></b></p>

<p>Horizon 1: Continuous Improvement, specifically the use of S2S expertise and reach into schools to facilitate stronger reading engagement is crucial. This exists in a limited way however we are yet to reach all schools. Our approach needs to be strengthened and expanded at a national level. There is an opportunity to lead thinking and work in reading engagement. To do this we need to develop a compelling message, sharing effectively the impacts reading for pleasure can have on individuals and communities. This could involve undertaking research on impacts on student achievement, life outcomes, community wellbeing; the role of library in supporting this; as well as developing partnerships to drive nation-wide initiatives. Under this horizon the mention of “South Auckland literacy programmes targeting Pacific peoples’ literacy levels” is problematic. This appears to fall well outside of the National Library’s remit, for example the project seems too specific for a strategic directions document and lacks scoping, it is local rather than national, about literacy acquisition rather than reading engagement, and potentially caters for a niche already well served by others. We support the establishment of a New Zealand Children’s Laureate and the position’s stated purpose to champion the cause of reading.<b></b></p>

<p>The Horizon 2: Next Generation “promotion of reading engagement as a response to adult literacy challenges” is problematic. Depending on how exactly this is defined (for example via specific programmes like that in South Auckland discussed under Horizon 1) this is a new and significant area of work for the National Library, and likely to require careful planning, the development of partnerships (with for example adult literacy groups, adult education providers, workplace education providers) and significant resource. Such an initiative would necessarily need to involve public libraries. There are still populations in New Zealand that are not close to a public library. How do we provide equitable access to programmes for isolated communities? In the first instance it would seems sensible and more effective to leverage existing S2S expertise, resources and relationships to strengthen the focus on children, young people and their school communities. If well done this could have a long term effect, and may eventually impact on adult literacy levels. Related to this is the need for a shared vision for school libraries and an understanding of their crucial role in promoting reading engagement.<b></b></p>

<p>Horizon 2: Next Generation is the most important, both in regards to the proposed increased emphasis on te reo Māori collections; and the preservation and accessibility of the National Library’s documentary heritage collections.

Through community partnerships, digitisation, and technology we have opportunities to strengthen institutional and individual access to Māori language content, and heritage items. This will support the continued sustainability of te reo Maori as a living language; share National Library expertise; and establish a platform/framework enabling others (including institutions and future generations) to interact with content. It is interesting to consider how these items might be made accessible and relevant to New Zealand’s increasingly diverse population.

<p>In spite of the acknowledgement of the overall diversity of NZ’s general population, it would appear that essentially the focus is bicultural. This needs to be clarified, is the objective to embrace cultural diversity but with a focus still on the national languages? If so this raises issues regarding what it means to be a ‘national’ library in an increasingly diverse New Zealand context, how, for example, can ‘other’ New Zealanders access resources in their own languages (including resources for reading for pleasure). The proposed collaboration between New Zealand and Pacific institutions is important but also has challenges. These are in regards to capacity and resourcing, as well as different paradigms regarding preservation. This would be a significant piece of work and would likely require dedicated funding.</p>

However we would like to see more acknowledgement of, and compensation to authors for the use of their works.<b></b></p>

<p>Getting agreements in place for the digitised copies of the works to be made available over the internet will take time and negotiation.

<p>There are three aspects to digitisation - preserving works, managing / administering works and accessing works. If digitised works are to be loaned there needs to be a mechanism in place to ensure authors / creators are paid if the work is still in copyright.

<p>The next draft of the National Library strategic direction should state that removing barriers to share knowledge will be done in a way that retains the rights of copyright owners and authors. Removing such barriers without considering the authors will have a negative impact on innovation by further reducing the ability of authors (national library content creators) to make a viable living. Sometimes ‘users’ are given precedence over the creators and this should not happen at our National Library.

<p>It is difficult to answer yes/no to this question because of what is missing in this document. Too much is invisible. The lack of commentary about the business as usual operations of the Library underestimates the current rate and nature of change within the Library, particularly in the digital space. For the proposed themes to be achieved a strong, trusted national library is essential but the document says nothing about what a national library should be or what the vision for the national library in 2030 is. There is a lack of stretch in many of the documented targets even in the H3 dimensions. Overall there is a lack of aspiration and no sense that the national library might be, for example, 'a place where a nation nourishes its memory and exerts its imagination – where it connects with its past and invents its future'. Collecting, being a repository for the nation's documentary heritage, supporting scholarship, national identity, civic procesess and democracy in a rapidly expanding digital world characterised by increased volumes, complexity and fragmentation/creation of new communities via new technologies/social media should be a core theme for the national library in 2030.</p>

There is enormous potential to create a digitally savvy organisation situated at the centre of a national knowledge network that provides high quality services leveraging new and emerging technologies with particular emphasis on computational interrogation of data. This organisation and these services could be available to support a greater range of communities across the whole of New Zealand – scholarly, humanities, research and science, students, Māori in a way that creates real advances in information use and re-use and knowledge creation.<b></b></p>

<p>To enable easier access to the taonga that we are guardians for. Nothing beats the real thing, but digitisation along with the supports to ensure that there is equatable access (Digital literacy and access) can allow for the surfacing of more taonga so that people are more likely to discover the most relevant information to their area of interest. This is not a replacement for being able to access the real thing, but just an advance indexing of it that allows it to be surfaced with more information and context. I feel that there is an additional piece of work that goes along side of this, which is facilitating the ability for users to bring their own knowledge and taonga with them<b></b></p>
