<p>Yes / no option forces a 'no' response here! Brief mention of productivity in the plan but no apparent plan for the role of libraries (and library networks) in growing sustainable businesses, contributing to economic development, creating jobs or enabling people to develop income-streams. These are major opportunity areas for the National Library. Dissemination of knowledge and information on opportunities, innovation, export, disruption, thought-leadership, etc. Overseas, the GLAM space (galleries-libraries-art-museums) is starting to get serious about its role as a catalyst for all levels of business, including start-up and incubation space. A document for 2030 needs to reflect this and incorporate some action plans to achieve it. Niche areas around developing lightweight transferable Intellectual Property (e.g. authorship) need to be developed. Strategies for engaging with business would be good.

<p>Yes / no option forces a 'no' response here! Similar reasons to those given above. Business, jobs, employment, standard-of-living can all benefit from library. Historical role of libraries as places of betterment (e.g. workingmen's libraries), technical repositories, etc. National Library doesn't appear to be picking up on international trends in GLAM space or leading the way with innovative and ground-breaking programmes which can lead to better outcomes in economic and social areas. For instance, can National Library be used to measurably grow GDP or to build better houses? Can National Library lead with crowdsourced discussions / initiatives or thought-competitions?

Could be anything from programmes to develop light-weight transferable IP among library users (such as authorship strategies and incubation) through to cutting-edge GLAM-related projects or more significant plans to involve business and develop economic strategies leveraged off library platforms. Te Papa is effectively trying to run a crowdsourced programme to find and develop ideas which leverage off its specialities and collections and National Library could do the same (this is a smart thing to do as it brings in fresh thinking and new skills at little cost to the organisation; the pay-offs are potentially massive, ranging from public engagement through to ownership stakes in spin-off business propositions incubated at Mahuki.)<b></b></p>

<p>The opportunity to think big, the willingness to share infrastructure and the geography of New Zealand lends itself to (demands) a common approach. It's not hard to see how digital services can be instrumental in social wellbeing, economic success, equality of opportunity and better, more efficient public services across New Zealand, from cities to the most remote rural areas. These are all priorities of the New Zealand Government. If technology infrastructure can be harmonised across New Zealand and if public service resources (teams, money and building assets) can be pooled in key areas, this will reduce costs and improve service delivery. Individual public organisations can then share common digital means - such as systems, networks and information - which will lead to faster, better and joined-up delivery and decision-making for service users. Indeed, New Zealand, with its natural advantages of scale and autonomy, could very well set the lead for the rest of the world in showing how libraries can deliver in other areas such as health and social care integration, protecting vulnerable children and adults better, putting the public in control of their interactions with government.<b></b></p>

<p>The strategy shows the importance of striking the right balance between local and national delivery and leadership. It struck me that there is a strong will to change and a genuine recognition of the need for national and local services to work together. There was also a clear recognition of the importance of relentlessly putting the citizen at the heart of digital design and that because ICT is fast-moving, processes for its acquisition, adoption and exploitation need to be faster and more flexible. It is the ability to put it into practice that is the real challenge. It is a call to arms for the challenge of digital transformation: policies, standards and national priorities but equally sets the context of the specific priorities, politics, democracy and geography of New Zealand There is a huge ICT professional opportunity from digital change and no shortage of exciting and innovative technology projects. Protecting the status quo is not an option and protecting ICT professional jobs actual requires embracing change within the function, acknowledging the need for different skills, governance, technology, joint delivery and agile methods which allow service leaders to innovate more freely with low-cost open source tools.<b></b></p>

<p>Not problematic as such but requiring a huge amount of interaction and change management. Indeed it will be critical to develop a content rich, exciting brand and a vision that people will desire rather than see as default. Need to invest vision time and energy in bringing people on board. So whilst New Zealand can set the direction, create the policies, establish funding mechanisms and change regulations which are conducive to digital delivery - and even help to shape the market around some of the essential common infrastructure components - in the end it will depend on driving a willingness to work together and to compromise on some local ambition in the interest of joining up services.<b></b></p>

<p>New Zealand can set a lead and can demonstrate how the management and sharing of personal data can be done in ways which protect the interests of the individual. It can show how a nation can use new national digital technology for the benefit of citizens. New Zealand can be the exemplar of shared ICT to enable shared public services across urban and rural areas, between different public service agencies, neighbouring authorities and culturally diverse groups. Citizens can be confident in common standards, such as data protection, openness and privacy. Digitally and culturally excluded citizens can be supported across organisations and sectors. Contracts and supplier engagement can be handled both locally, in terms of responsiveness of systems, but also nationally through common procurement mechanisms. In this way more time and effort can be spent on exploitation and use of ICT and less purely spent on tendering, procurement and supplier monitoring against SLAs. I could go on with many more examples. My hope is that New Zealand services can work together to achieve an outcome -an international exemplar, proving just what is possible from digital ambition- striking a balance between national policy and vision, but reflecting local delivery, diversity and priority.<b></b></p>

<p>Overall, they provide a good foundation to grow. One knowledge network - yes. NZ is too small to waste resources by putting them in silos. Nation of readers - see above. The Services to Schools section would fit better within the Ministry of Education, leaving NatLib to focus on what it does best and uniquely - collecting and making accessible our NZ heritage, past and present, and assisting other GLAM agencies to provide access for the general public to the world's knowledge. Words as taonga - partly. I don't think a specific and presumably timebound exhibition belongs in a plan to 2030, except as an example. The redeveloped auditorium is a separate, significant bullet point. The discussion space is commonly known as the ground floor. What control will NatLib have over "Strengthened New Zealand and Pacific collections across institutions"?<b></b></p>

<p>1)There is no mention of the English (or New Zealand English) Language as a taonga.

<p>My feedback focuses on Words as taonga! I recall some 30 years ago concern was expressed about kaitiakitanga mō ngā taonga in the National Library, particularly ATL. Today, both concepts are well embedded in the NZ psyche and vernicular. Keep this focus because it links with article 2, Te Tiriti o Waitangi, it reminds librarian experts about duty of care, and it is the only kupu Māori in the themes. It places tangata whenua at the heart of the library's core business. Words are how we tell stories, how we share and question ideas, how we communicate. Words as taonga reveal our storied souls, our powerful forms of writing, and our lines for dramatic presentations. Words give the author, the poet, the orator, the shop-owner, the customer, the elderly, youth, children - everyone - a literary licence to express our energised thoughts and connect us to our past, our present, our future. Words are the vehicle for expressing the full range of human expression and emotion - sad, mad, glad and bad! He taonga te reo, he taonga ngā kupu, he taonga rangatira te tangata!<b></b></p>

The power of the strategic directions ensures that no-one is treated as a stranger, it welcomes people, and through the tools of digital technology connects both the provider and user of services locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally.

<p>The National Library network and its connection with national galleries, archives and museums for many, means that people have to travel in order to access those treasure troves. Digital technology assists that connections for people anywhere and anytime. However the libraries under the auspices of local governments and in the 2,500 schools in our country reveals the huge potential for sharing content, connecting families and people so that we can all confidently share and enjoy a key aspect of our country's heritage. The National Library of NZ stands alone in the word for providing a vibrant and effective school service. We cannot lose that service and potential for supporting our greatest national asset – the children of today who we must nurture so that they thrive, achieve, and belong as the future leaders of our country.<b></b></p>

<p>This is a personal choice for success in support of Māori speakers, Māori readers, Māori writers, dramatists and actors. It is a fertile ground for Māori contributions that can be shared with all. Ko te reo te mauri o te mana Māori - the language is the source of Māori identity. In the whole world it is one's language that demonstrates one's culture and identity as unique and extraordinary. For Māori to survive in the rich tapestry of peoples of this world, then the language must a living language. How can that be achieved? It's so simple - kōrero, kōrero, kōrero - speak it, speak it, speak it! From a word, to a phrase, to a sentence, to a paragraph, to all forms of human literary expression. And for those who are still learning - kia kaha! Critical awareness and a shift in supportive attitudes can ensure that all languages are honoured as sacred, but especially the Māori language in its homelands of Aotearoa - NZ.</p>

<p>Please note that in Horizon 1 you have used the term 'university' libraries when I think what is meant is 'tertiary' libraries. Using the term 'university' excludes all other tertiary libraries such as ITP or Wananga libraries. Suggest you use the term 'tertiary' libraries instead, and only use the term 'university' when it applies specifically to university libraries. Also in Horizon 2 I think there is the potential for tertiary libraries to take part in a NZ wide shared library management system (wouldn't necessarily have to be exactly the same solution so long as there was interoperability) and registration. A point to note: The term 'university' library is used when what I think is meant is 'tertiary' libraries. Using the term 'university' excludes all other types of tertiary libraries such as ITP and PTE and possibly Wananga libraries. Also, as a manager of an ITP library I would like you to consider including ITP libraries as well as school and public libraries in possible national contracts for licensing e-content and new systems. We have found EPIC to be valuable and would like to see this concept extended.<b></b></p>

<p>Great strategy so long as the focus is not just on print literacy but on literacy as a broader concept that includes visual, information, trans-literacy etc. Words as taonga in any form (not just in print). So for example, when strategies are developed for improving reading levels this should include "reading video" as well as "reading print". Understanding how to navigate and make sense of all forms of knowledge transmission is crucial for people to develop their full potential and to contribute to the prosperity of New Zealand.<b></b></p>

<p>Recent experience (the Te Puna + Voyager replacements, the technology situation in the Molesworth St reading rooms, services to schools) has shown that the National Library struggles to engage and understand its stakeholders, let alone to provide solutions that meet their needs. While the idea of one library platform for New Zealand has merit and some support within the library community, the Library needs to radically shift the way it works with other libraries (and its other stakeholders) to enable this.</p>

<p>The Library should draw on its strengths, and one of these is the public goodwill associated with libraries. The Draft Strategic Directions to 2030 makes a strong case for the ongoing importance of reading and literacy to the nation. I see a number of areas to expand our work here, particularly into other literacies. "Creating a nation of readers" is a great slogan, but the reality I would like to see is a nation of readers, thinkers and creators supported by the National Library.</p>

<p>I think this is a great idea, but a fraught one. If the Library wants to lead cross-sector work, it needs to be careful to work within (or expand) its mandate, lest it quickly lose its seat at the table when political situations change. While we are the home for books and reading, there are a number of other agencies in the education space.</p>

<p>These are all so vague as to be meaningless.

I would be focusing on returning resources to a programme that young readers (and their teachers) actually used and needed: the services to schools programme. This is not as useful as it once was and I'd use the resource planned on these vague aspirations to instead resource it effectively.</p>

<p>These themes are indeed good things, but to me they sound like the strategic plan for a school library in the 1980s, not a national cultural heritage institution in 2030. Reading and words are great, but they're not everything! These themes are not forward thinking enough, although 'One Knowlege network' definitely has potential, but as written it focuses solely on public libraries.</p>

<p>There is no discussion of the digital divide, or different needs for various regions/ethnic communities across New Zealand.

<p>This is the essence of what we do.

<p>It completely leaves out unpublished Te Reo content, which should be an even stronger focus for preservation and access than the published materials, as the unpublished collections are one-of-a-kind, and many only available to researchers who can physically come to the reading rooms in Wellington, but also acknowledging that not all information is appropriate to be made more widely available. The National Library should work with iwi and communities to ensure that access to taonga is done appropriately and respectfully.</p>

<p>The document doesn't mention the National Library and Alexander Turnbull Library's service to the scholarly community, and all the ways in which it supports specialised knowledge and expertise, beyond just basic literacy skills. Obviously, we want a society where everyone is literate and has access to information; but we also want a society where people can be creative, and have big ideas, and make discoveries and new knowledge. There should also be more focus on relationship building, within the GLAM sector and with iwi and communities across New Zealand. There also should be a real commitment to matauranga maori, more than just a few token words in Te Reo scattered here and there through the document.</p>
