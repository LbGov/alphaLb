The central co-ordination and partnership model proposed, together with these strategic directions, represent best spend of public money.</p>

<p>Material which is uniquely of and from New Zealand is essential for research, creativity and innovation. In our view scaled up digitisation of NZ content would need to allow for the possibility of unpublished materials being as important or potentially of greater value for digitisation than published materials. Additionally, we suggest that analysis of user need would be required to guide the scaled up digitisation, to ensure a benefit for investment rationale. The document is silent on these considerations.</p>

<p>We have two comments: Firstly, we fully support the 'Words as Taonga' focus area and understand this to encompass the particular things that the National Library of New Zealand has at its heart: New Zealand's creations, music, cultural works, stories, meanings, creative outputs, language, usage etc. However the 'Words as taonga' phrase does not quite capture these concepts and could perhaps be revisited. We support the principles of targeted rather than 'blanket', value for money and outcome measurement and suggest these dimensions be tied into the three strong statements of need on page 2 to make the strategic directions more compelling.</p>

<p>I consider all these short sighted -there is no mention of the roles played by the special library sector - particularly govt, CRIs, SOEs - in developing this network. Special libraries are being reduced throughout the sector and yet there is an amazing collection of information that isn't being tapped in to by researchers due to it not being made available through standard library networks. For example - I work for an organisation that is the NZ repository for all reports from an international agency. These are not made available via traditional library networks as our organisation does not / will not subscribe to National Library services. The reason given is cost. How then can a 'knowledge network' be built if government agencies don't get on board with their own resources, or see belonging to already established networks as beyond their costs? I suspect similar scenarios are playing out in the NFP and private sector as well - all those I have worked for have had rich archival collections when they have had a librarian who understands the value. These disappear from view when a library is closed resulting in national resources being lost.</p>

<p>Perhaps just a consideration of how the nature of reading and literacy may be changing - how to move from a somewhat old fashioned view where academic types of people or those who like to read books for pleasure are the ones who feel part of the library? What about practical people who read in order to find out how to do stuff, or how stuff works, how something was implemented on farms last season so they can make a decision... care needs to be taken not to privilege some sections of the audience over others.</p>

<p>Partly. As broad themes these are fine in terms of areas of focus. I do feel the theme ‘a nation of readers’ has a sense of being dumbed down but realise we live in an age of sound bites. I think it would be more accurate to refer to literacy; whether people choose to read or not is not the issue, it is the capacity to read that matters and allows for choice. I note on page two you refer to improving literacy, but relate it solely to social participation and work skills, when research shows considerably broader benefits.</p>

<p>I believe New Zealanders should have simple access to the collections held by National Library because so much of this material is unique and has incredible socio-historic value for people. With easier access there is potential for curation and co-creation, and for these collections to be the spark that ignites new works. This should be your unique selling point because access to these collections is something only you can provide.</p>

<p>A minor concern with this is around managing users who move a lot and may leave a trail of fines and lost items in their wake. Of far more concern is the idea of one library management system (LMS) given the current problems with Kotui, and the annual cost of the service. I realise an LMS might simply be a discovery layer pulling together information from many systems, and that Kotui as a service might not mean the current SirsiDynix system. I could not justify the cost of the Kotui service when we can easily run and improve Koha for less than 10% of that cost; it would be a waste of ratepayer money. If you go down this route I would expect to see an open and transparent procurement process which included Koha, as a locally developed open source system which is used by major consortia overseas and has satisfied users within New Zealand. It is also a concern to me that there is continued grumbling about the SirsiDynix product and vendor response, yet Kotui the service seems reluctant to acknowledge this and deal with it.</p>

<p>This outcome is in Horizon 3 but I don’t believe it can wait that long if digital collections have increased tenfold in 5 years and continue to grow exponentially. Every year this work is delayed means more and more content is not adequately preserved, making the eventual work harder and the potential loss of digital documentary heritage greater. I think it is vital this work is begun as soon as practical so that institutions across New Zealand can work efficiently towards digital preservation using one set of well-understood, achievable standards.</p>

<p>The National Library Act refers to “The purpose of the National Library is to enrich the cultural and economic life of New Zealand and its interchanges with other nations by, as appropriate,— (a) collecting, preserving, and protecting documents, particularly those relating to New Zealand, and making them accessible for all the people of New Zealand, in a manner consistent with their status as documentary heritage and taonga.” This proposed outcome under Horizon 2 seems to begin moving responsibility to institutions outside of National Library. I am especially concerned about preservation, as I feel this is too specialised an area for most public libraries to be responsible for. If words as taonga is a main thread in the strategy, then the care of our documentary heritage must be the role of our specialist organisation, National Library. I believe we should expect you to be the ‘keepers of the last of the last’ particularly for New Zealand materials. I am concerned that smaller libraries, who have relied on National Library for ‘last of the last’, may lose this service but are not in a position to maintain large stacks themselves.</p>

<p>Yes and No. 1.1. The idea of one knowledge network is transformative and its realization would lead to a more sustainable and accessible library system across New Zealand. It would be beneficial to print disabled New Zealanders, increasing access to a much wider range of content. 1.2. The emphasis on literacy is very broad, and could only be achieved through collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, especially the education sector. This is transformative, from a passive provision of access to content, to taking on a literacy leadership role; but will require advanced relationship management, and a new skill set for staff. If the strategy included an inclusiveness component, it would suggest benefits for blind and low vision students. 1.3. There are aspects of the third key area that seem to blur the lines between institutions, and collaboration again will be key to success. There are components which seem like appropriate areas for National Library to lead. However, this seems like the least transformative key idea, containing more aspects that are business as usual and there is scope to be more aspirational.<b></b></p>

<p>Yes and No. The proposed changes will help transform National Library from an institution into the leader in the New Zealand Library sector. This is vital, as there is a current lack of coherence, and leadership could itself be spelled out more strongly in the strategy. The call for collaboration, sharing, and reforming existing knowledge networks all make sense. It is meaningful to want to lead the literacy movement; a National Library is where we should be able to easily locate and celebrate important collections. However: 2.1. Can National Library lead a literacy reformation without a clear mandate from the education sector?<b></b></p>

<p>For the Blind Foundation, the concept of one knowledge network is the most important. Improving digital access to information to New Zealanders across the country aligns with our strategic direction. We aspire for all print disabled New Zealanders to have equitable information access, and this idea would help realize that, ensuring that geographic remoteness, licensing or local body funding models were not an impediment to access. The focus being placed on digital is relevant to the Blind Foundation, as one of our strategic goals is to have a 100% digital content library service by 2020. An outcome that we would like to help achieve is a National Print Disability Collection that is digital, download based, with curation, support and systems shared across the library sector. This would help ensure that the one knowledge network is inclusive and reaching all New Zealanders.<b></b></p>

<p>The strategic directions in the draft document align closely with key objectives within the Blind Foundation’s strategic plan 2015-2020. These include an objective to contribute to the availability of a print disability collection in every public library by 2020, which aligns with the concept of a one knowledge network. Our library system is also targeting 100% digital content delivery by 2020. As an organization, we are also looking to partner with national and community organizations that can help us support vision impaired New Zealanders in their local community. The goal is for our clients to be active participants in their local communities. In this context, with a single knowledge network, local public libraries would become a primary destination for print disabled New Zealanders seeking information, or support in accessing information. Our youth library system is also seeking to broaden the access our younger clients have to information. The nation of readers’ idea supports this drive. Our primary goal for these students is to ensure they have authentic literacy skills, a key building block for a productive adult and working life.<b></b></p>

The desire for partnership is because the Blind Foundation cannot drive this unsupported; and because it will benefit New Zealanders on a much wider scale than those who are vision impaired.

<p>The new Services to Schools is a disaster. We received 200 books as a "reading engagement" loan. We are an urban decile 8 girls' high school. Most of the books were suitable for children aged 8-10, including non-fiction picture books about dinosaurs. We received novels from several series, but not the first one, just random later titles from each series. We wondered if the staff had actually looked at the covers or just grabbed the nearest things off the shelf. Fewer and fewer teenagers like to read for pleasure, and it will take partnership not just with school and public libraries to fix this, but some kind of dialogue with teachers and curriculum planners. I love Paperspast and Digital NZ, but the National Library's website is terrible - too cluttered, to hard to find things.

<p>Yes and no. The proposed strategic direction is not incompatible with the NLNZ Act, but one proposal, creating "a nation of readers", stretches the mandate. One Knowledge Network - yes.

Nation of readers - this will require significant commitment from other govt depts and agencies, about which there is little or no information (or even the suggestion that it is one of their priorities). Literacy is not the role of the NLNZ, but literacy support. "Creating a nation of readers" is an ambitious goal, but more the role of the Ministry of Education?

Theme three seems a little unclear and the "nation of readers" seems to be in isolation - unsupported by other agencies with whom collaboration should be expected.<b></b></p>

<p>The consultation document does not adequately address the impacts of - and NLNZ's planned responses to - continuing developments in information technologies. IT developments have dramatically re-shaped libraries' environments, and reasons for existence. There seems no reason to assume that the previous exponential rates of change for information technologies will not continue. To retain its relevance, NLNZ should add value to New Zealand through providing - and using - information technologies that facilitate knowledge creation by end users; and sharing of that knowledge among those users - especially knowledge unique to New Zealand.<b></b></p>

<p>1. The NL role in ensuring that all people across NZ have good access to the ideas and knowledge of the wider external world is very understated here. NZ's success surely depends on this more than on an inward-looking focus of nurturing home-grown knowledge , important though the latter may be. The access to the world's knowledge has been part of the NL's public good purpose since the 1930s and the NL should be assured that the outcomes are in fact being sustainably met before abandoning this purpose. 2. Effective alternative local delivery channels. There is an emphasis on the public library network, but in reality this is mainly a recreational / leisure type role as exemplified in their governance arrangements and financing. It should be presumed that this NZ PL sector will undergo the same sort of wind-back as now happening in the UK; the NL would be unwise to assume that it is an effective local channel for NL delivery. So put more emphasis on direct-access channels as are used e.g. for accessing "Papers past" etc. <b></b></p>

<p>NL should be spending more time understanding the publishing industry and its trends. The NL offers direct access to citizens via (i) off-the-street access to its Wellington "National Cultural Institution" site and (ii) direct on-line access as for "Papers Past" etc. The plan would be better positioned if it emphasised this direct access capability and made its customer interface as intuitive and easy-to-use as other direct access resources which ordinary internet users are well accustomed to use.
