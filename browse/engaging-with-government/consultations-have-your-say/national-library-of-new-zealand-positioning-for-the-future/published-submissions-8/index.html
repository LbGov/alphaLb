<p>The strategic priorities appear to be forward thinking and innovative. They are relevant to New Zealand society and provide leadership both to the library sector and beyond that. As an arts organisation with a focus on increasing readership throughout New Zealand we are particularly delighted to see the focus on creating a nation of readers. Additionally it appears that the idea of the one knowledge network could benefit school libraries, a key tool for promoting NZ books and authors.<b></b></p>

<p>There is little information available on the readership of New Zealand books.

<p>A number of the suggested initiatives are likely to be of benefit to increasing readership throughout New Zealand. However a strategy to increase reading throughout New Zealand is vital to ensure that organisations are working in partnership towards agreed goals and to avoid duplication of effort and resources. Additionally, any strategy would ideally go beyond only looking at literacy programmes; the link between reading for pleasure and literacy is strong but there are many other initiatives and organisations who are working in the area of reading development but not strictly focused on literacy. These are potentially key partners in the development of a national reading strategy.<b></b></p>

<p>Broadly speaking yes, however we believe that there are opportunities where themes could be expanded on. 1. One knowledge network could be expanded to include reference to digital literacy and the development of the skills required to ensure all New Zealanders are able to engage with the “One knowledge network.” 2. A nation of readers. We feel that this is a very important area to focus on, and we have a role to play as a thought leader and connector with other partners in this field. 3. Words as taonga. We treat all of the taonga that is in our care with the upmost respect. There is a question around how taonga is defined. Whilst we appreciate the discussion that this term instigates, without facilitated discussion this may appear too limiting. Other suggestions could be stories as taonga or documentary heritage as taonga to better encompass the breadth of what is entrusted into our care.</p>

<p>We think that the National Library has a vital role to play in ensuring that we are a nation of readers by taking the lead role for this in the government sector. Other government agencies have responsibility for ‘bits’ of the picture ie. in compulsory education or in tertiary education but no agency seems to have a lead in this area. That role could extend to ‘monitoring’ across government. For example some of what happens with the Ministry of Education ie national standards for literacy does not neccessarily support creating a nation of readers, in fact it could be seen to actively mitigate against this. Whose making sure that right across the board, we can all read and in fact like reading?<b></b></p>

<p>We like this one and hope that the National Library will continue to explore the layers of meaning in this statement with staff. For example some explanations of ‘taonga’ imply a level of ‘tapu’ – what implications might this have for the National Library. As a current example, the late Sir James Henare said that the existing copy/copies of Te Tiriti o Waitangi are ‘tapu’ because of the ancestors who signed. What does ‘tapu’ mean in terms of how documents are managed, stored, accessed, exhibited etc. As speakers of Māori we want to encourage Māori words in everyday use but caution the National Library to make sure staff are adequately prepared. Be courageous!</p>

<p>While we like the statement ‘words as taonga’ we don’t think that there is a strong enough emphasis on the National Library’s role as ‘kaitiaki’ of words. Not only as the nation’s kaitiaki of words but to assist all New Zealanders to store and preserve their important documents, videos etc – ‘words’ in one form or another. We like the fact that the Alexander Turnbull Library offers their expertise to community groups through their conservators and oral historians. These initiatives support people to become kaitaiki of their own ‘taonga’.<b></b></p>

There is a real risk they will be misunderstood, and that a lot of energy will be put into explaining their intent, even though the underlying ideas are good. 4. I'd like to see more connection to the innovation sector. How can the collections of NLNZ contribute to this? For example, in the area of research done through Te Pūnaha Hiringa: The Maori Innovation Fund, for example?

<p>Better access to and easier reuse of the Alexander Turnbull Library and National Library collections is something that we feel that the Library as a whole has to constantly work towards and invest in. The definition of ‘better’ moves on with each achievement that we make in this area and we need to constantly reconfigure to meet clients expectations. It is heartening to see this idea so prominent, because we believe that it is important that clients can easily and directly access our collections without compromising the care for collections that our clients expect of the National Library. We are happy to see NLNZ/ATL making a commitment to access. A much easier online service will also help us offer more targeted services to our onsite clients, who can have quite different needs to online users. Throughout, we want to ensure that people always have a place to come to ask for help and expertise, whether online or in person.<b></b></p>

The DIA as a whole need a space like this internally so that large groups can meet at once. The Public Programmes and He Tohu offerings at the Library need to be able to present to more than 80 people in one go. Conferences here would benefit enormously from this resource. But it seems an ill fit for a strategic document like this. This is an operational decision that should be well off the blocks by now, and should not need to ‘compete’ in this strategic space!</p>

<p>We feel that care for NZ’s heritage is missing or dumbed down in this work. This is a major strength for us. We should be bringing it more to the front – in 15 years people will want to know how well we did at collecting the 90s/2000s digital output, for instance. Likewise, as we digitise more content, we can’t lose sight of the emotional and educational importance of analogue material to our users. We are happy to see signs of investment in core services. We feel that although many of our services that clients use are developed to be iterative, we do not adequately provision these areas to actually iterate once their phase as a project is over. Projects should not finish, they should turn into programmes. We want to listen to the client more – surveys and analysis of our online users, and more opportunities to test online material directly with clients before we deploy. Librarians have a role as educators – we value this work – if we invest in less procedural work on the front line of customer service, this would mean more talks, publications, research in partnership with universities, other libraries and independent researchers.<b></b></p>

<p>The themes attempt to incorporate a number of those themes and ideas crucial to the concept of a 'national library'. These include notions of library as both a service and place; library's role in connecting people, histories, collections and ideas; the leadership of nation-wide systems; potential for collaboration and partnership across relevant sectors; and the importance and enjoyment of reading as a foundation life skill or disposition. It is a shame the integrated nature of the three areas isn't more explicit or explored. Via the diagram it is possible to see they are connected but at the 'horizon' and activity level this becomes lost, leaving the strategy feeling fragmented.

<p>I am struggling with the notion of ranking the proposed ideas. For me the impact would be achieved via a variety of pathways and initiatives which work together in compelling ways to transform attitudes and environments. Having said this I do think a national reading strategy is paramount. This should be adequately resourced, involve all key stakeholders, be evidence-informed but particular to the NZ context, and real about trade-offs, risks and what can potentially be achieved. It is via a document such as this that other needs-based initiatives should become apparent. I also support the establishment of a NZ Children's Laureate. Such a position has proven effective overseas in regards to advocacy, and would be relatively simple and quick to establish.<b></b></p>

The benefits of reading for pleasure are almost invisible currently in the NZ context.

<p>I'd like to see more emphasis on creativity and how the National Library support the creative capital of the nation. One Knowledge Network references innovation and the first para of Words as Taonga notes that GLAM institutions are expected to encourage the creation of new works but there is scant discussion of how the National Library proposes to support individuals and groups in their creative endeavours. The first two NL themes of "collect, connect, and co-create" are strongly represented in this document but I don't see much explicitly about co-creation which is a shame as the National Library is clearly a source of creative inspiration - close engagement with the taonga made available can release people’s imagination, encouraging them to express new possibilities. There is an opportunity to develop approaches and systems that create an environment to encourage the free flow of information and ideas and build New Zealand’s intellectual and creative capital. The proposed new space for discussion is an interesting one (see also Te Papa's Mahuki) but perhaps there is also scope for supporting technology-facilitated collaborative content creation and creativity in our increasingly participatory culture.<b></b></p>

<p>I feel another strategic goal could be to inspire research and inquiry. Our National Library customers are also ‘inquirers’, from teachers and children using our resources in inspire inquiry in the classroom to researchers using our digital and physical records and resources to find information they need. This goal could connect the other 3 goals — inquirers need a path to find knowledge (One knowledge network), they need access to documentary heritage to learn from the past and inspire the future (Words as taonga), and good readers make good inquirers — and sometimes interest in a topic can motivate readers (A nation of readers). On a micro-level, adding inspiring research and inquiry as another strategic direction would also support Services to School’s lending model and work with digital literacy. Adding to this, inquiry resources also date quickly. Should we be also positioning ourselves as supporting/expanding schools’ non-fiction resource base to ensure their collections stay relevant to learning?<b></b></p>
