<p>Yes the broad themes “words, reading, knowledge” are the right focus. However, this theme is “word”-centred and could be seen as a rather narrow view of what libraries actually collect and the service they provide to their customers. It should be acknowledged that The documentary heritage of music culture only partly involves words - it also involves sounds and musical scores. Although the byline also mentions “sounds and pictures”, this still does not encompass musical scores.<b></b></p>

<p>To establish National contracts for licensing e-content should be cost effective and achievable with a country our size. Partnership with publishers, copyright policy makers and rights management organisations makes sense. The National Library is the logical institution to facilitate this eg more material like EPIC would be positive. NLNZ could develop (or partner in the development or NZ-wide licensing of) tools to assist other institutions to improve access to digital music-related collections, e.g., standards-based web score viewers and AV players. Metadata standards for music content, especially around unpublished material, are inconsistent across NZ institutions. “One Knowledge Network” could involve better alignment around this.<b></b></p>

<p>This would be a vastly expensive undertaking and very risky. We already have a really great interlibrary loan system that enables customers to borrow from anywhere in the country. It is efficient and cost effective. It enables a more personalised and flexible service to customers who may have very specific needs. It controls and monitors the movements of items very closely (often very expensive material). From a music point of view it would be a challenge to follow up a customer from the far end of the country who has not returned a complete set of parts. Interloans provides that security for us. Digitisation: Maintaining integrity of and access to digital information during software upgrades The recent upgrade of Te Puna has not been successful in terms choral and orchestral sets as all specific holdings data was lost. Consequently libraries have had to resort back to the print catalogue of Sing and Orchestral Scores. Where has all this data gone? Huge organisations like OCLC do not have the flexibility to cater for small or specialised customer groups/collections and their needs. One size does not necessarily fit all. Another example is The NDHA links, which has brilliant access already to all New Zealanders, will apparently be lost in the transition to the new Voyager catalogue. Both of these issues will require huge amount of work around which is very time consuming and costly. Often the work around is not really an adequate solution to the problem. There is a lot to be said to have digitised material duplicated on multiple platforms and this way if there is a problem with one it is still accessible. Eg mirroring National Libraries digital holdings on other sites and resources like the Open Music Library Ensuring that vulnerable media are given priority in terms of digitization so that they are not lost This digitisation process needs to include New Zealand produced AV material in outdated formats held by the National Library, specifically material on audiocassette and VHS tape. These two magnetic formats are constantly degrading with time even if not used, so their digitisation needs to be given higher priority than more stable material such as print.<b></b></p>

<p>But why not also a nation of musicians? There is equivalent research on the extensive benefits of exposure to music from an early age. The national economic benefits of music “literacy” are also well documented, in terms of employment/revenue around creative industries. Music should be in this theme somewhere. One example of a country developing musical literacy on a national scale is Malta who offers its entire population free access to the music learning website www.meludia.com. Other nations provide free access to Naxos online. Here is an opportunity to use things that children are interested in such as, hip hop, pop music, kapa haka and sports to encourage reading and learning and in the process building a nation of learners and creators and users of culture.<b></b></p>

<p>Shared expertise to enable New Zealand’s cultural heritage institutions to acquire, curate and preserve our documentary heritage and make it accessible is a primary function of the National Library. There is an implicit understanding that this is what the National Library does. The emphasis is heavily around facilitating access to collections. This is good but there is also a need to build collections that will serve future generations. Coordinated collecting strategies could be part of the “national documentary heritage framework” (NDHF). If the NDHF was constituted as an independent sectorial body, one of its functions could be to advocate for improved resourcing to keep the current institutional network capable, diverse and sustainable. Many of the challenges of collecting, preserving and making accessible documentary heritage (esp digital) could be markedly improved with better government commitment.<b></b></p>

<p>I have no quarrel with the themes as such but they completely miss out the production of content. When the word 'research' is used it seems to be linked to access r literacy. There is no mention of the Alexander Turnbull Library, New Zealand's premier research collection and for generations the engine for the production of nowledge through research. How would we be able to pursue treaty claims without Turnbull's magnificent collections of manuscripts, maps and Land court hearings? How would we be able to revise and understand our cultural history, social history, family history, literature?There is no point to innovation without content as endless studies have repeatedly shown-access alone does not make knowledge.<b></b></p>

<p>Not really, because not complete. The Positioning for the Future document seems to reflect a limited focus, which suggests that the stakeholder consultation process might have been rather constrained. Furthermore, strategic directions need to articulate how new strategies and directions will be positioned alongside essential and ongoing core business, The themes focus on only part of the purpose of the National Library as set out in the 2003 Act, ( not to mention the purpose of the Act), and interpret it fairly narrowly. The strategic directions ignore the important role of the Alexander Turnbull Library, and also ignore the major knowledge creating institutions of New Zealand, the universities, polytechnics, and scientific research centres (unless they are simply included in the term 'traditional partners', and other institutions with major research collections. As a result, the strategic directions are unambitious in some ways, and over-ambitious in others, and measures of success do not take account of where responsibilities lie ( which is sometimes with other institutions).<b></b></p>

<p>All are important. But this is a key strategy to enhance Internet-based access to unique NZ materials, to support research and knowledge creation. However, strategies encouraging the publication of New Zealand books as e-books are also extremely important - one reason (among many) being that some public libraries are cutting services to the a growing elderly and house-bound population, suggesting they make use of e-books. Currently this cuts many people off from access to New Zealand publications.<b></b></p>

<p>Most of these 'Horizons' are very similar, and most are highly important. But they need to be followed through with serious action and resources- I note the comments in one submission about poorly chosen resources provided by the Services for Schools Division and have been concerned in recent years by cutbacks in this area. The bold ambitions of the Strategic Directions must be supported by the appointment of adequate numbers of professional staff.<b></b></p>

<p>Appointments such as this tend to be 'preaching to the converted'. More pragmatic and innovative measures (at flax-roots level) would in my view be more likely to affect change with the people you are trying to reach. Literacy is a key issue, but the actions noted are the responsibility of public libraries. Should the NLNZ strategy include working with local and regional bodies to ensure public libraries ( and therefore membership and programmes) remain accessible by all New Zealanders. While NLNZ doesn't have to be the leader in all such activities it needs to 'think outside the box' how it can better strengthen existing initiatives. Areas of adult literacy NLNZ could consider getting more involved with include prisons, and community groups working with new immigrants. (This would require staff with expertise in this area. New Zealand librarians are NOT trained as literacy or ESOL experts.)<b></b></p>

<p>I think that this 'horizon' best encompasses all the horizons listed under this heading; I find it to some extent invidious to try to prioritise them, when they are all similar and inter-related. However, NLNZ must take a lead in preservation, both of physical formats and digital formats- it is resourced to do so, and the wording of these horizons suggest it may be pushing responsibility out to other institutions. At the same time, its own taonga the ATL, is not highlighted as a priority. I welcome the responsibility NLNZ is proposing to take for documentary heritage preservation in the Pacific Islands region. Such programmes are essential to preserve fragile and irreplaceable documents. However, I would also like to note that while I agree that language(s) are taonga and documents (both oral and written) can be taonga, I am not sure that is is helpful to label 'words as taonga ' as a strategic direction. This is possibly a slogan or catch-cry that will not have along shelf-life.<b></b></p>

<p>It can be tricky working with International vendors and publishers, BUT it has been done on national scales overseas and on State and Territory levels in Australia. NZ's population number makes this achievable, if funds are available - National Library needs to be working across Ministries (Education, Health, Business &amp; Innovation, Primary Industries, etc.) to get high level buy in for access to resources. Health is an area that applies to all New Zealanders, from birth through their entire lifespan, keeping the population well, engaging them with health providers when needed, and providing the health providers with the best evidence available to enable them to provide the best care possible. Health sector librarians have worked on a plan for a national electronic health library over a number of years, but have been unable to take it forward. It needs a strong champion at a high ministerial level.<b></b></p>

<p>There is an role for the National Library to lead within the Library sector and take responsibility for supporting Library Managers. There is a huge opportunity for building connections and collaborations across all library sectors, that I do not see occuring currently. In Wellington over the past 2-3 years there have been a large number of changes in Library Management positions across all sectors. The National Library is ideally situated to bring these managers together to connect and discuss the challenges in their organisations and sector. This is distinct from developing leaders, which is being well met by LIANZA. Managers can face challenges from all directions in their roles (from their staff, users/clients and managers) and Library Managers can feel quite isolated. I would like to see the National Librarian host a meeting of cross sector Library Managers, to establish the common ground and build networks for further collaboration.<b></b></p>

<p>Content providers (publishers, authors, illustrators) will need to be recompensed. A book cannot be made available for free to all, even though digital systems allow this, unless there is some method of payment to those whose work has gone into creating it. A system similar (but separate to) PLR could be the way forward - content providers are paid an annual fee for having their work available digitally. Payment on digital lendings (rather than holdings as is the case with PLR) may be workable if the data can be captured. This would reflect the use of the book, and so the loss of payment to the publisher/author/illustrator that has occurred due to the reader accessing it digitally for free on the library system rather than buying it.<b></b></p>

<p>We are keen to partner to deliver on all strategic directions.

We anticipate that we would work together with partners such as the Network for Learning and the Australasian Open Access Strategy Group. We also affirm our advisory role in ensuring that government content collected by the library is assigned CC licences as required by the NZ Government Open Access and Licensing (NZGOAL) and will assist directly as necessary. Strategic Direction 2: We see CCANZ’s key partnership role as assisting students, teachers and school librarians to only use and create content licensed for legal re-use. Strategic Direction 3: We see CCANZ’s key partnership role as working with the NLNZ, Te Puni Kokiri and tangata whenua to develop free legal tools for indigenous knowledge works. This would continue our current Indigenous Knowledge project.<b></b></p>
