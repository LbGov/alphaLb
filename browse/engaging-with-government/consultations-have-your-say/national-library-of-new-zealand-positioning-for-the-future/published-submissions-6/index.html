<p>There is an important opportunity when considering connecting schools to the collective resources of public libraries and how this can strengthen literacy levels and community engagement. As noted, “working alone, the National Library is limited in its ability to bring about such change.” The FOLIO project (www.folio.org) is a community collaboration to reimagine library technology. The project will enable the Library to work with other libraries and commercial service providers in innovative ways to bring about fundamental change. FOLIO allows this because of the scope of participants and the vision, ideas, and resources that participants worldwide bring to the project. Given FOLIO's approach - supporting innovation through extensibility - it will allow the National Library to address the three horizons - to improve what the National Library does today, to support investment in next generation of products and services and help innovation in a way that has long-term impact. The project’s outcome - a flexible, open platform that supports resource management and is built for innovation - will support the Library’s need to accommodate new workflows and will allow the Library to tap into a rich marketplace of applications - open source and commercial - that will support evolving needs.<b></b></p>

<p>There is opportunity to collaborate more closely with the global community of libraries and service providers. In many ways, this global collaboration is embodied in the new open source project, FOLIO, that has brought libraries and commercial entities together to re-envision library technology. FOLIO can support the objectives of the ‘one knowledge network’ by connecting libraries and users in innovative ways, supporting not just access to content, but driving towards new services. The community at large - libraries and vendors - can work together to imagine and develop these services and deliver applications such as predictive analytics or machine learning. Moreover, the project can drive student reading engagement and information literacy of children and adults through creative means such as gamification or social networks. Library membership can be promoted through ‘loyalty’ programs that build on a user’s interests and encourage engagement with the library. And the project can support the description of unique digital collections and support discovery and access from within different environments such as learning and content management systems. As such, the project aligns well with the goals outlined by the National Library of New Zealand and its quest to position itself for the future.<b></b></p>

<p>Technology in libraries has largely remained stagnant: library management platforms often remain closed, are built on legacy architectures and are monolithic in nature. By contrast, many other industries have seen their ecosystems open up and deliver unprecedented innovation. These industries have witnessed a growth in collaborative and innovative projects and patents are made available. Companies like Google and Facebook make a variety of open source technologies available to spur innovation and help bring about radical change by harnessing the power of global participation, knowledge and talent. The time has come for the library industry to follow suit. The FOLIO project, a community collaboration to develop an open source platform, will support traditional library management functionality, yet is built for innovation. The FOLIO platform will be extensible at its core, so anyone can freely build on core functionality or extend the platform through the development of applications that will deliver new services. Libraries can leverage the platform’s core functionality, utilize existing applications, and either develop new applications independently or work with other libraries, any developer or commercial vendor. The project, which is well underway, is bound to deliver new approaches to the challenges that libraries face in an ever-changing world.<b></b></p>

<p>Essentially these 3 themes are what one would expect: access to information; reading and learning; heritage.

<p>well yes and no. They are appropriate to the role of a national library, However given that this is already 2016, and the purpose is positioning for the future, I don't find the initiatives to be particularly bold or ambitious. They are certainly what the wider community has been waiting for and expecting for some time in order to catch up, but they don't go far enough into the future, and the big transformative idea to really position the National Library as vital in turning knowledge in to value is not yet here. Hopefully it will emerge through the feedback process. And while the intent of working together is win/win and mutual benefit, there is still a place for national leadership and responsibility for providing funding for solutions which deliver important public good outcomes, such as equity of access to information to enable an informed citizenry able to participate fully and contribute to society.<b></b></p>

<p>This is urgent, should be able to be delivered in horizon 1. NZ and particularly NLNZ are missing the boat on this opportunity, there is a lot of catching up to be done. If NLNZ does not move quickly there will be other players who have captured this opportunity. This should go hand in hand with establishing a strong easily accessible one stop shop knowledge platform making it easy to access NZ content as well as the world of knowledge. National contracts for e-content needs to be for the benefit of all libraries as a national solution, not just school and public libraries - this needs to be a collaboration of the whole, as an expanded EPIC solution.

<p>This focus on a library management system for public and school libraries is too narrow and old fashioned, also hard to achieve and would be obsolete before it was finished. There are better ways of achieving the same. The outcome could be to focus on developing a shared platform or portal, which would make it easy to deliver easy and equitable access to the world's knowledge. Recognising that NLNZ has a role in helping to fund and achieve this equity. Developing a new website is fundamental Business As Usual and does not warrant being listed a strategic initiative.

<p>Well motivated and important initiative, but critical to be clear about NLNZ role. It is not working for children to have NLNZ supporting schools while public libraries support children and their families in their lives outside school. There are too many gaps that the children fall through and it is too hard to put wrap around reading and learning support around vulnerable children and their families. It is still not clear that Services to Schools are meeting the learning needs of children in schools, it all feels inadequate. This initiative should be about piloting different approaches to support the reading and learning development of children, especially through their families, and might include supporting a public library in a area to deliver the whole of a child's reading and learning support in schools and at home. Not enough focus on learning and creativity in this section, which is the reason for literacy. Also oracy should be added as being as important as literacy and numeracy. What is a modern life? - does this mean the skills necessary for participation in 21st century?<b></b></p>

<p>This is so overdue, material already digitised is at risk, and there have been requests for NLNZ to be active in this space for many years. Solutions should recognise NZNZ responsibility to help make content available, it cant be just pure user pays which negatively impacts those institutions which took the initiative and carried the cost of initial digitisation of their resources for national and international benefit. Also very important is digitisation of Te reo material but I guess this is also included in the digitisation initiative in 1?<b></b></p>

<p>This would assume continuation and development of the role of the Alexander Turnbull Library but is not restricted to that and can include further digitisation. Of course it is also not limited to books but can include also pictorial documents such as posters and maps. At present the NL (ATL) receives material by gift and bequest. In addition it receives copies of record of all NZ publications. However a strategy would assist collaboration with other institutions, libraries etc involved in collecting heritage material. It could assist with rationalisation of purchases and help avoid competitive bidding when heritage items are offered for auction. It could help in identifying target items.<b></b></p>

<p>I am glad to see the draft and have the opportunity to comment. While it does not perhaps figure in a strategic. document I would like to note the importance of the NL's public programmes as a "shop front" for its work. This may come to focus for a time mainly on the constitutional documents when these go on display. But the excellent range of the public programmes should continue over the wide range of the NL's activity and interest to develop the Library's public profile and constituency.<b></b></p>

It also feels like casting around for a purpose for Services to Schools as digital technologies change the role they have had in the NZ schooling system. The strategy doesn't focus enough on transformative digital technology. Conversely, it also doesn't focus much on the unique physical taonga that is the ATL collections.<b></b></p>

<p>Partially. The biggest challenge for citizens, businesses, organisations, including libraries, is the ubiquitous nature of digital and the rapid pace of technological change. The next 17 years until 2030 is unlikely to be any different. Therefore the National Library's strategic directions need to focus on how it fulfills its purposes, as outlined in the Act and which are equally important, so that New Zealanders can benefit from the opportunities of our hyper-connected, digital world. The first theme "One Knowledge network" addresses some of these challenges as does "Words as Taonga". However, the Nation of Readers, while important does not address the significant issues of digital literacy, data literacy and the need for people to have a much broader range of skills to effectively participate in a digital world. It seems to me that the focus area is more likely to be part of a bigger theme around creativity, innovation and productivity of which literacy and reading is a subset.<b></b></p>

<p>A partial yes. The National Library's role is defined in the Act. The report on the consultation with stakeholders clearly supported the key role that NL plays in "ensuring current and future generations have access to recorded knowledge and services that enable them to live, work and innovate in this digital, global world. They need: • Content and collections that are freely available and easy to discover, use and reuse; available over time for future generations; • Infrastructure, both physical and digital, that supports the exchange of knowledge and data both between systems and tools and between people; • The skills and expert support to make use of the knowledge they need to be productive and engaged citizens. National Library fulfills this mission both directly through its collections and services to individual researchers and other users, and indirectly through its support of other libraries and schools and its collaboration with similar cultural and collecting institutions. This network of libraries, museums, galleries and archives collectively provides public access to the knowledge and stories important to our nation, linked by a common purpose of enabling greater understanding, social cohesion, cultural diversity, learning and the creation of new knowledge and innovations."<b></b></p>

<p>Mass digitisation of NZ content is long overdue.

Digitisation of NZ published items needs to happen on a mass scale - dont worry about whether someone else has already digitised it overseas - a lot of time and money could be spent trying to work out what has been done and what hasn't which could be spent on the mass digitisation. This is NZ knowledge and should be under NZ care and preservation. If there are two digitised copies in the world this may be a good thing from the point of access and preservation.<b></b></p>

<p>Getting more NZ content in a digital format has two facets - one is the digitisation of existing print material and the other the acquisition of born digital material (or published both in print and digital). Out of copyright and should be done now. The material still within copyright is more problematic and is probably an horizon 2 or 3 area. Making electronic legal deposit work in a much less manual way and ensuring that ePublished materials are routinely collected and in the NDHA will require a climate of trust with publishers and authors. Building this relationship, being clearly able to articulate not only the why but the how this will happen and the safeguards for publishers and authors is not going to be easy. But it does need to be tacked. A review of the Public Lending Right for a digital world is also vital. And the fund should be increased as it has not been for a significant period of time. This is a tangible way that government can met competing objectives for access to knowledge with ensuring appropriate recompense for the product of the creative process.<b></b></p>

<p>I the National Library wishes to continue with this strategic priority as it stands then the most important area for action is in taking a lead on trying to bring the various agencies, including libraries to take a collective impact approach to literacy. I see this as a five year research project where all the different agencies sign up to an agreed set of measures and a concerted program of activity, seeded by government. Alongside the programme of activity and measurement one of the Universities could put a research framework around this to truly determine what the longer term benefits of this focus might be.<b></b></p>

This will need investment and it is an area ripe for collaboration both internationally and at home. Some universities (Victoria University Library for one) have purchased Rosetta and National Library has expertise that can be shared but also can learn from what others are doing. This area can not be seen as a money making service provided by National Library to other institutions but a collaborative approach where partners pool resources, both financial and intellectual to get the best for the country.

<p>There have been two attempts to do this in the past and mostly they have not landed anywhere, largely I suspect because if it is acknowledged that we have a distributed heritage collection model then government is worried that other institutions will seek funding from the central coffers. However the reality is that our documentary heritage IS distributed amongst different cultural, tertiary and public institutions. ATL may be a preeminent collection but it doesn't collect everything either. Where do we find our scientific documentary heritage? Who holds unique materials? The issue it seems to me is we need to understand the drivers for why we want a national documentary heritage framework. Is it because we want to get more funding, or more equitable funding? Is it because we want the public to be aware of the key institutions, a consciousness raising with stakeholders? It it because we want flush out little know collections and make the public aware of what is in those collections? What is the place of non New Zealand and Pacific materials in such a framework? Once we know what is wanted from such a framework we might have better success.<b></b></p>

<p>1. the National Library's role (through ATL) of supporting scholarly research including the independent scholar - a more proactive role in demonstrating that the humanities, social sciences and history have much to teach us about our country, its place in the world. Digital humanities is where NL could interface with the tertiary sector, particularly University libraries. A more proactive approach in fostering innovation and creativity - social entrepreneurship - through ATL. 2. the strategic importance of the services that National Library provides in collaboration with other libraries or on behalf of other libraries. It is too hidden and not properly resourced. The role that public libraries play in making real One knowledge network was dramatically advanced when the APNK was initiated nearly ten years ago. It is urgent that a refreshed model happens now and does not wait until there is more flesh on the bones of the strategy. There should be no question that this is a legitimate part of the NL's purpose and as such it should continue to be partially funded by government. 3. Further down the track the NL needs to have a clear funding strategy for the delivery of its purposes under the Act.<b></b></p>

<p>It is great to see the NL looking towards its future and how it best contributes to "turning knowledge into value". The language of the document will be important. Others I note have commented on 'reading' and 'words' as being limiting and not really getting to grips with the wider issues and I agree. The plan claims to be bold - and I encourage you and the government to be bolder. This will need investment - often quite modest investment will make a huge difference - the $2m added to the NL baseline in 2006/7 made a huge difference to how NZers accessed content through the birth of Digital NZ and APNK. This kind of investment is modest in government terms. Mass digitisation is a bigger investment but the longer term benefits for getting NZ content to where the eyes are and making it available for research and reuse will be significant.<b></b></p>

<p>The first narrative that mentioned te reo Māori in the document was a deficit sentence. That deficit sentence came immediately after the paragraph talking about super-diversity (200 ethnicities, 160 languages) which sums up the current state of affairs in Aotearoa at the moment. As a Maori and speaker of te reo, I didn't make mention of any initiative regarding te reo, as anyone who understands the 'decline' in te reo knows that whatever is proposed by the Natlib isn't really going to address the problem.

<p>The document seems to lack a clear articulation of the National Library role in delivering work towards these strategic goals. Will you deliver the services, facilitate others to, or adopt a contractor/provider approach? We strongly support current examples of opt in service delivery e.g. EPIC. As a large public library we value the benefits that come from a nationwide negotiation for services and products, particularly if this allows us to enhance service levels. Therefore, continuing to build in an opt in/tiered function remains a high priority. From an external perspective, we believe that the National Library’s role as a leader has been lost within DIA. We see its voice tempered. Their strategic voice needs to be heard. Internally, this needs to be reflected in strategy, agility and leadership. Internationally, senior National Library representatives need to be at overseas forums as the NZ representatives and conduits for overseas library and information dialogue and developments. Communication is key for sharing with the NZ library profession and central government.<b></b></p>
