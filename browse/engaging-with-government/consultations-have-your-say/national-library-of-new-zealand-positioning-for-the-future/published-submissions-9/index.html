<p>There is real potential to create a more joined up and seemless expereince for our users across the state. One area that the National Library might focus is the Community Archive. The Community Archive is an important catalogue, electronic database and website supporting community archives groups and historical associations of all sizes. For these communities it is the knowledge network that allows them to showcase their collections to the research community online, hosted by Archives NZ. Due to limited resources it is often the only outlet many communities have to connect with their users/researchers and communities online. Currently the Community Archive is underfunded and undersupported, but has real potential to be a central repository for collections and organisations of all size. Collaborative leadership on the part of the National Library to support, grow, and further develop the Community archive as the central place for cultural heritage institutions of all shapes and sizes to share descriptive access to collections would go far toward creating One Knowledge Network for heritage collections. Especially if this service could be linked with Digital NZ, enabling access to descriptive records and digital records where available.<b></b></p>

Expanding literacy to digital literacy would also be nice as those with low literacy generally are also more likely to be locked out or experience digital divide issues.<b></b></p>

A strategy that recognised the importance of collecting NZ changing demographics will need to incorporate new ways of digital collecting.<b></b></p>

<p>The importance of ensuring access and skills to digital content is not well reflected in any of the themes. A "nation of readers" is not just about literacy, but about digital skills and access to online resources. One knowledge network does not reflect the importance of universal access. The WIP figure that 91% of the population are internet users is problematic because the sampling methodology is not able to reach the "hard to get" people in the population. It is our view, based on the families and whanau that we work with, that the percentage of the population is under-reported. Even if the 91% figure is accurate, that means around 400,000 non-users (noting 2 year olds are now tablet users). The National Library has a role in helping these people access knowledge.<b></b></p>

<p>The Lesbian and Gay Archives of New Zealand (LAGANZ) Trust was formed in 1992. It’s Board of Trustees own, on behalf of the lesbian and gay communities, the growing number of collections which now make up the Archives. The initial core of the collections goes back to an initiative of the National Gay Rights Coalition in 1977. It developed into a research library and archives known as the Lesbian and Gay Rights Resource Centre which was placed in the care of a trust in 1984. In 1988, to ensure the collections a secure home, the trustees made an agreement with the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington for their permanent accommodation. Collections are actively being grown to capture the diversity and growth of LGBTITF communities in New Zealand. The collections remain under the ownership of the Trust, and are open to researchers on the same basis as other research heritage collections. This agreement secures their safe storage and assures that access to them is supervised.<b></b></p>

<p>From a LAGANZ perspective: One knowledge network is a tāonga - visibility and accessibility to LGBTITF material / collections wherever they might be across institutions in NZ including libraries is important for community. Feeling LGBTI knowledge is valued and respected is also very important for the same community, so the values and principles that underpin one knowledge network are equally important. The relationship between LAGANZ and the Alexandra Turnbull Library is underpinned by mutual respect for what each other seeks to achieve. A nation of readers - reading opens the door wider for access to the history and aspirations of LGBTI communities, organisations and individuals. Words as a tāonga - words are tāonga that can never be taken back. Once words are said or written they can be open to scrutiny and critique. Importantly they reflect a snapshot of a person, community or organisation's thoughts or processes at a particular point or period in time and help to build a picture for both current and future generations; thus their transformation into tāonga or treasures. Words as tāonga reflects the commitment of LAGANZ to provide an appropriate environment to hold the memories of LGBTITF individuals and communities.<b></b></p>

<p>The broad themes of "information access for New Zealanders" and "collecting and preserving documents" are good and relate to the purpose of NLNZ in the legislation. However, I feel that the third theme "a nation of readers" is not really the core business of NLNZ. Improving literacy in NZ (the ability to read) is really the role of the Ministry of Education and encouraging New Zealanders to improve their literacy by providing a range of resources they will want to read is one of the roles of school and public libraries. NZNL could back them up in this through interloans but it should not be one of three major strategic directions. If a third strategic direction is desired, supporting, encouraging and promoting high quality New Zealand writing would be more appropriate as would the provision of high quality, affordable opportunities for librarians to upskill and ensure that libraries in New Zealand are well resourced with competent, up-to-date, professional staff. (Who will then be well equipped to reach out to their communities and encourage reading, social participation and finding information.)</p>

<p>I see the role of a national library as safeguarding a nation's literary heritage and providing access to it for the people in that nation. Additionally, it may encourage the creation of this literature and information. It is also a 'backstop' for libraries in the nation, especially public, tertiary, school and not-for-profit libraries. A library for libraries in the way the Reserve Bank is a bank for banks. It should support researchers, although not necessarily research purely for commercial gain. This document appears almost to suggest that the purpose of NLNZ will be to encourage as much financial gain as possible with the smallest amount of investment it can get away with. New Zealand has other agencies for that.<b></b></p>

<p>Partly because of the way they are resourced. School libraries (in state schools) are funded by central government through school operations grants. They resource the curriculum schools are required to deliver. Local government libraries are funded by ratepayers. They want their rates to buy resources of general interest to their community, not to resource school curriculum at the expense of their information and reading preferences. They may not be able to afford the staffing, space or information resources to do both. The second reason is that I would be a bit concerned about the integrity of subject headings. Most schools teach, and prefer to use, the simpler subject heading designed for school catalogues rather than the LoC system which is much more complex and too detailed for the needs of school libraries. Many students find the search skills hard enough to use and grasp on the simpler system but it is a really good place to begin teaching electronic search skills they can later further develop on electronic databases and beyond. This could be lost if our resources were catalogued on a system shared beyond our sector.</p>

<p>I am concerned that if schools become "more connected to the collective resources of public libraries", regional inequality could increase. I am unhappy that we were told last year that school libraries could turn to the internet rather than relying so heavily on non-fiction books and are now told that a mere 14% of New Zealand published works are available online and they are subject to pay wall and broken links. Extending public library membership to everyone from birth does not mean that everyone will be willing or able to make use of that (eg distance, device access, print disability, inability to use the public library system, disinterest). As far as I know, membership is free for ratepayers and local residents at all public libraries but 'over 2 million' members would indicate that half (or more) of the NZ population has chosen not to take advantage of this or is unaware they can. There is neither the flexibility nor the word-space to say everything I would like to in this feedback format.</p>

<p>generally agree that all three focus areas will shift the library sector to be better positioned for the future, however the National Library's role in that will alter depending on the initative undertaken. What could be made more explicit is how the three themes will be interconnected towards achieving the aspiration of a proporous New Zealand. Looking ahead to a horizon of 2030, with technological advances, urbanisation, increased migration, and other societal and financial pressures - the role of a library is likely to evolve. The ability for the final focus areas to flex in this rapidly changing and dynamic world will be important, and in my opinion, the need for documentary heritage, digital literacy and citizenship, improved connectedness, increased cababilty to access resource and information, and the nation's ability to read, are all strong foundations for positioning the library sector for the future. Libraries, including the National Library, need to adapt to this fast-paced changing environment by transitioning from traditional models, whilst understanding the role our libraries currently play in our communities is critical. Challenging status quo can be difficult and controversial, but I admire the outward-focussed ambition the discussion document presents with some of the opportunities identified.</p>

<p>Under the approach of collaboration and working together, I feel there is a good fit between the potential role of a 'national library of the future' to achieve the aspirations outlined in the document. Success will require more than just a national library however, many partners will be needed to realise these aspirations. Relationships, partnerships and collaboration are all key to success - however are also very resource heavy / time consuming. Ensuring a national library is structured with appropriate capacity and skillset will therefore be important so that the library is agile enough to be proactive, can move with pace, and has the ability to be creative.<b></b></p>

<p>Ensuring NZ's history is documented and this knowledge is shared for future generations is important, and in my view digitisation, while problematic and expensive, is crucial to ensure the longevity and accessiblity of key resources. Further to this the impact that greater sharing of knowledge can have on education, economic growth and what it means to be a New Zealander can also be significant.

<p>While I do not totally disagree with the concept or its ambition, in response to this question I do feel this would be problematic to implement across the library sector. To be successful it would need to be an opt-in service (even if at first) to ensure its impact reaches the targeted audience, and it would need alignment to a shared vision for a shared library network and capability development for the sector. It's not unachieveble, but a question to consider is whether the benefits of economies of scale, greater co-ordination and improved access through one library network outweighs the costs that would be associated with this project.<b></b></p>

<p>A national reading strategy could not only lead to a nation of readers, but also a nation of thinkers and a nation of inspired curiosity. What makes this theme so important is that the other two themes are reliant on a population being able to read for them to also be successful. A reading strategy with a distinct collaborative focus ensuring our population 'can' and 'do' read is important. The project also has the potential to be the cornerstone for the Nation of Readers theme to ensure an ongoing creative and innovative dialogue around other potential projects and partnerships post-adoption of a strategic document.<b></b></p>

<p>Similar to my comments around the LMS project, ensuring the benefits outweigh the costs of a project of this nature would need assessment. As it stands, while I understand what it this project is trying to achieve, I'm not convinced this is the answer to creating a nation of readers. Alternatively a 'national readers week' initiative that was part of a co-ordinated national reading strategy could be a huge driver for people of all ages (not just childhood) to have a library card and more successfully meet the objectives of this initative. While incredibly complex, there could be something around a universal library membership which may also be worth exploring.<b></b></p>

<p>Making it possible for the population outside of Wellington to see and engage, discuss and debate NZ's documentary hertitage in a virtual space will be important in the future. The emphasis of physical space in my opinion could be less important for the National Library over time, and the role of a 'library' compared to a museum or community hub is something that may become more grey and problemtic in defining 'what is a library' into the future.</p>

<p>- Things in 2030 will be very different to 2016. Despite a small amount of context this document is largely silent on the potential challenges the library sector could face in the next 15 years, and therefore its unclear on the 'state of the future' that the document is trying to position itself for - Second to that, a stronger connection needs to be made between the interconnected nature between the three theme areas and the positioning that is being proposed for this potential future state - digital literacy and citizenship require greater visability and proactive planning. The library sector has a role in this - there may be work across the sector in preparing the library workforce for the future. Its likely going to require different skillsets than the library workforce of 2016 - and with that a project with tertiray institutions focussed around career development pathways could be important to look at.<b></b></p>
