<p>The Introduction describes them as "a bold and ambitious set of strategic directions". This is itself a bold claim, not borne out by the rest of the document, yet there are strands of activity that are important for the NLNZ and for the wider community. While a primary purpose of public libraries is to foster literacy, the key roles of the NLNZ are firstly the collection, preservation and making accessible our nation's documentary heritage; and secondly furthering the work of other libraries in NZ. The strategy document pays lip service to this, but adds in a seasoning of social purposes and underlying assumptions in the additional challenges noted on page 2, that go beyond what NLNZ is mandated to deliver or can reasonably achieve. In particular, it is not the role of NLNZ to address social cohesion; and while libraries support literacy, the main governmental players in this area are surely MOE and MBIE. In a sense, we already have one knowledge network - it's called the Internet. It is not clear what advantages would accrue from the centralising tendency implicit in the theme that would outweigh the disadvantages of monopoly provision. It would certainly limit the 'benefits of diversity'.<b></b></p>

<p>A one-size-fits-all approach is a poor one, and it is hard to see how a national monopoly would avoid the stagnation, inertia and failure to innovate that is typical of centrally-planned and delivered systems - competition is the spur of progress. I would note also that there is no necessary link between shared membership and a single library management system - the former does not necessarily imply the latter. I further note that the costs of participation in Kotui are significant, and beyond the means of many small and medium-sized libraries.<b></b></p>

<p>I'm not sure any of the ideas in this theme are important - or rather, that where imoprtant they fall within the remit of the NLNZ.

<p>Overall, the document lacks focus, clear outcomes, plain language and defined goals. There is an element of question-begging in the much of the language ('the increasingly complex problems we face as a country', 'allowing us to enjoy the benefits of that diversity'). A simplified, focused approach enables success to be gauged. As it stands, it's hard to see how one could tell whether the strategy had been successfully achieved or not. This focus might most usefully be on: 1) a commitment to providing online access to all collections by 2030 would be (a) in line with NLNZ's legislative remit and (b) a measurable goal. 2) the collecting and preserving of the vast quantity of NZ-originated born-digital content; and 3) supporting other libraries across NZ in their own efforts to provide access and preserve material - in particular with NLNZ's expert knowledge and advice.<b></b></p>

<p>The most obvious link is to the theme "words as taonga", since it fits with the core role of National Library is as a repository for knowledge. The addition of the other two themes recognises National Library's current work in supporting access and connectivity for public and educational libraries; and also the potential for National Library to provide leadership to support more effective strategies to build literacy. The latter goes beyond what most people would see as National Library's role, but it is a logical extension of National Library's role and expertise. It also fills a gap, since current national leadership on literacy (from MOE and TEC) focuses only on literacy learning, rather than on the habit and love of reading in families and communities.<b></b></p>

<p>We have been promoting the need for a national literacy strategy for some time. This needs to go beyond just learning to read in schools and second-chance adult learning, to include the value of intergenerational connections and of reading for information and pleasure in homes and communities. We suggest that a national strategy should include: Making sure people knew what provision was available, via a national campaign; Continuing to build and support a capable workforce; Informing our practice, policy and investment from data; Ensuring learners in programmes make progress and are equipped to transition to higher levels of study; Working with stakeholders to ensure quality programmes across the system, fit for the diverse purposes of adult lives; Developing a research programme that informs practice and policy; Growing uptake from most vulnerable and high risk or high need learner; Working with partners to ensure all government departments and services know about and respond appropriately to the literacy needs of their constituents or clients; Working across sectors to reduce the pipeline of young people leaving school with insufficient literacy; Commitment to raise the early oral language and school readiness of all our children.<b></b></p>

<p>This action is important - in fact it is crucial to the success of any national reading/literacy strategy; however it would be complex and would require concerted effort over several years before any concrete results could be expected.

This backbone coordination role is central to the effectiveness of any cross-sector collaboation and is often under-funded.<b></b></p>

<p>Taken as a whole, the strategic themes seem to have set aside the primary function of the National Library which is clearly set out in the Purpose statement in the relevant legislation. Two of the three (the knowledge network and words as taonga) are valuable areas of focus provided that they are seen as contributing to the legislated role of the National Library. The 'nation of readers', however laudable a goal, is not the responsibility of the National Library, and embracing it would involve a significant shifting of scarce resources and an inevitable dilution of the core business.</p>

<p>As before, none of them. Apart from the fact that this is not and should not be core business, most of the descriptions of what success would look like are vague and provide no measure at all of any real achievement. The first, for example, under Horizon 2, suggests that success will consist of some partnership seeking to achieve an improvement. That strikes me as remarkably unambitious, and even if achieved would offer no guarantee of success, only of some commitment to try to achieve success.<b></b></p>

<p>None of these options quite capture what I think is needed. There should be a national reading strategy involving cross-sector partnerships but led by the MoE (in close partnership with the National Library) rather than by the National Library. The MoE already provides high-quality engaging instructional reading materials to all primary schools that (if used as intended) would lift literacy levels and provide a clear pathway to reading for pleasure but these aspects are not clearly articulated by the MoE. By “successful literacy programmes” I think you mean “reading engagement programmes” such as those run by The Reading Agency in the UK and these would certainly be effective but I think a wider aim of a national reading strategy is that all students can read (through clearly articulated MoE expectations for classroom instruction) as well as wanting and choosing to read.<b></b></p>

<p>Broadly, yes. We assume the definition of “reading” is broad, and referring to all taonga held by the National Library, so access to content in all mediums held is required for all people of New Zealand. We particularly agree with the sentiments about NZ being as small as some cities, and able to adopt a city-mentality in regard to the National Library’s role in procuring content services on behalf of all libraries. The National Library are the only organisation in a position to make these negotiations on behalf of all New Zealanders. We feel the National Library should ensure service/technology providers prioritise the security of personal data, and should not accept solutions that dictate decisions about ownership or distribution of taonga, or the ability to engage with other content services, locally or internationally. All software should support not only open standards , but also open source software. The NZ government open access and licensing (NZGOA L), framework, including the recent Software Extension, is extremely encouraging in this regard. In short, NZ needs to adopt open solutions, in order to engage with local and international initiatives, provide solutions that can be accessible to everyone, and to look upward and out.<b></b></p>

<p>Yes - but only if you are funded to undertake them properly – otherwise activities you are mandated to do are not done (refer below) and that means no one else does either – to the detriment of New Zealand. We see that the National Library has an important role beyond that defined in the act, as a leader facilitating agreed strategies for literacy, supporting/developing/protecting our culture through managing heritage materials and enabling fair access to knowledge. The National Library also has a role supporting and enabling (possibly through managing the funding of) public and private organisations to deliver on that strategy. Given the mandated role of the National Library we have concerns that the National Library and Central Government in general appears to be divesting cost and responsibility to Local Government and other user groups. For example: a. Cuts to Services to Schools resulted in protest action on your front steps. b. Similarly the reduction in Services to Public Libraries has raised concern and comment. c. Certain Collections have deteriorated through funding cuts, impacting collection preservation quality through degradation and loss. The lack of reformatting has an impact for future access, a particular example is the national Newspaper Collection.<b></b></p>

<p>Many organisations have investment in current systems, collections and IP that support their operating model e.g. University IP management. Any attempt to impose alternative universal solutions is likely to be highly problematic. This area will require considerable analysis to identify the drivers behind organisational business models and cross sector collaboration to reach agreement on where and how access may be given or monetised. Of equal importance the National Library risks disenfranchising communities of their own rights to choose a system that suits local needs by imposing national infrastructure across them. We think it is important that communities or interest groups have the right to retain and develop their own identity and the choice of infrastructure can be a determining factor in their ability to execute their plans.<b></b></p>

<p>I have a lot of admiration for the way in which New Zealand's National Library has always gone beyond the traditional role of a national library--the preservation of a country's heritage material- to take a much wider role in our country's general literacy. Their Services to Schools, for instance, is unique. No other country in the world has a similar support system for teachers operating on a national basis. I believe we should be proud of our innovation in extending the traditional national library role.<b></b></p>

The heritage function, and support for young New Zealanders in the education system are the other two roles I consider vital for the National Library to establish leadership--even to maintain its relevance-- in today's information landscape.<b></b></p>
