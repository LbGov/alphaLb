												We have questions on each strategic focus area, but if you want to provide a general comment only, please do so here.
											</h4>
											<div>
												The overall directions very positive. I do Reckon you need to do more to promote what you do and what you have  My family - aunts, grandparents - have used you a lot in the past few years but only because I told them about you.   I think you are a bit of an unknown secret   Clear intention about moving to records transfers in digital format good.  Pleased to see national archives on this track as I'm worried about how government depts are managing digital records.  Strong leadership from you on this would be good 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												You need to improve your web site, also Archway not that easy to use unless experienced or a professional.   More digital content really needed, and paying online My family have come in to you but for me to use directly, I want digital content because I'm still working   I'm a big ancestry user and that's how to connect these days
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												you could help with well organised information like Archivist's sign posting?  Setting it out clearly on line and making it easy for people to use.   An archive overseas I use a lot has thousand of non indexed documents online which sounds great but it's a pain really.   I have to go thro stuff page by page... So I reckon the archive and Archivist should do a lot of indexing to help find stuff 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?

												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?

											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												No response
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes it should.  We haven't been able to find important information and your staff told us that it had never been transferred to Archives which I find is a shocker really.  Reckon you need more power to say what has to come to you.  I used to think everything important did
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												No response
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												No response
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												No response
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Just this is good to see.  We - my family - have used you a lot and you hold a lot.   We thought it would all be at the Alexander Turnbull, but then we almost stumbled on you.  You are the ones who really hold new Zealands history but no one seems to know.  Reckon you should promote yourself more.  And you need to be a strong leader to ensure our history ends up with national archives.  This document asks the right sort of questions but step it up more please

												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?

											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Tell stories that relate to the communities and that people can have a personal connection to (and contribute to). For example use social media channels and develop a strong public programme (both online and in the 'real world'). Ensure that information/ archives can be found easily, used and re-used. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												1. Ensure that archives are clearly described, the context and provenance are accurate and meaningful (using appropriate archival descriptive practice - to maintain the 'formal' record - what ever it is or may become in the future). 2.  Create an environment and archival management system (or other solution) that will allow communities and individuals to enhance and contribute to the description of archives (to optimise discoverability and re use) - e.g. crowd sourcing...etc. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Access channels, archival systems (currently ARCHWAY) and descriptive information included in the system do not adequately reflect or support a Maori view of knowledge or knowledge sharing. For example it is not clear where taonga/ information related to different groups (such as iwi or hapu...etc) exist within the Archival holdings. Where it is known it is not easy to add this information to the system - for staff or for 'users' (e.g. crowd sourcing to enhance descriptive information and tagging). There is also a limited resource of staff at Archives New Zealand with appropriate knowledge, experience and expertise to enhance records retrospectively. 

Because transferring public offices do not (and probably should not?) have a requirement to add descriptive information of high value to Maori as a part of the current transfer process, the responsibility to enhance these records (to unlock their full value for everyone) belongs to Archives New Zealand (post transfer). 

 Also, the current physical environment, services and approach used to engage in archival research do not meet the needs of Maori for various reasons.  Archives New Zealand needs to make changes to foster a greater awareness of Te Ao Maori into modern archival practice and radically assess the way access is delivered (on site and online) so that they can actively engage with the wider Maori community in meaningful and sustainable ways.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												This is a tricky one .... it depends what the role of the public office is, what the records are and if they  choose to identify the records as open or closed access. I think it is probably more beneficial to stick with the current regime where 1. public office identifies what they think the access status should be and 2. access status is reviewed by a group of people (in consultation with the public office). Then the final decision is made (currently by the Chief Archivist).  

It is probably best for an external body to approve access status as this would hopefully support transparency and better trust in government information in the long term....
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Not sure about this one - the key is to ensure that information is discoverable, understandable, and accessible long term. Identifying clearly what is important information and which public offices (or functions of government) are generating important information. Then these 'functions' or the public office/s involved in generating that information could be more closely supported or regulated (in particular with regard to how data is being generated, shared and re-used).  A solution to identifying who is accountable or responsible for maintaining this information is an issue that would need to addressed, (particularly in the context of collaborative work for example).

											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes. It is quite controversial to suggest this approach, and is goes against traditional archival practice/ theory. However, there would be a benefit in developing an acquisition policy (much like a collections policy - which I know is a naughty thing to say). I would see an acquisition policy sitting along side a more traditional appraisal process, where the public office identifies the 'business' value and retention periods for their records as a part of standard appraisal - which would most likely in the future (say 10 - 20 years time for example) be an activity incorporated in to system design to allow for automated sentencing/ disposal/ transfer. The second phase of 'appraisal' using Archives New Zealand's acquisition policy could take place at this time. The acquisition policy would view the records through an 'archival lens' and presumably would be focussed on records that are of high 'cultural' or societal value, records that may in future may protect the rights and entitlements of the people...for example. I could see this working better than the current system of 'collecting' that we have in place. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I think it should do both but focus on high risk/ value functions of government. E.g. - It depends on the function the public office and the type of information they are generating. 1. Identify which functions or public offices are generating 'high value/ high risk' information. 2. Regulate the development and implementation of the systems (at the point of the systems being designed) 3. Monitor how the systems are being used and the quality of the information being generated/ managed using the system.  People create, use and manage information...it's a symbiotic relationship between systems/ tools and people, this is why you need to regulate both recordkeeping/ information management and system design.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Both. In house - digital preservation in particular - this team should be able to advise and collaborate with Public Offices. System design - regulate and support/ advise.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Again it depends on what the function of the Public Office is and what type of information they are generating. I'd probably lean more towards having mandatory standards (that are realistically implementable) and have less of them. Then identify the Public Offices that are generating very high value/ high risk records and more actively regulate or support? these sectors.

												We have questions on each strategic focus area, but if you want to provide a general comment only, please do so here.
											</h4>
											<div>
												The general strategy is very positive.  The three focus areas create huge potential for moving forward.  It is important that national records are recognised as "the most precious" of our assets.  These national assets in fact tell the New Zealand story, and therefore crucial to capture information.  Leadership and regulations are required to ensure key areas are not missing.  
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Better promotion needed, as many people do not know much about Archives NZ.  A wider understanding of the importance of holding and accessing national assets would lead to wider usage.  Promotion material that could be used by other agencies would be useful.  Need to raise the awareness at an earlier age, by sharing some of the NZ stories, capture NZ tales, road shows to schools.  Connect to other networks for wider promotion and usage (e.g. SMART library network http://smartlibraries.org.nz/).  It must be user friendly - easy to use, easy to find information, easy to read (pitch for all ages).
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												A framework that is EASY to use - i.e. to capture/save content, to access/search/find information.  Create an environment that people are confident they can easily find what they are looking for.   Use technology (e.g. social media) to engage with all age groups.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Need to bridge the digital divide.  Encourage non-government organisations and iwi to share national assets.  Raise awareness of the value thereof, and also reach out to younger audiences to capture and promote "the NZ story".  Consult Maori experts.  Government to provide funding for resources and education to not only promote to, but to allow remote locations to be able to tap into the "digital' environment.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Better if external agencies set their own access status classifications.  It would better support transparency (open to sharing in own environment) and engagement (easier to maintain as it is more familiar), and ultimately increase wider engagement and trust in government information.   On the negative side, it will create more inconsistency, which means it is more difficult and expensive to administer.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												This is tricky.  Data sets generally contain sensitive information which are not shared publically.  It is important though that information is discoverable.  Source of the truth information, outlining data sources and contact details for further information should be available to ensure information is accessible long term.  This should contain Migration Plans to ensure information from legacy systems are captured.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												As above
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Processes should already be established whereby information is captured on an on-going basis.  Should agencies merge, cease to exist or names change, mechanisms need to be put in place to capture this information, and feed into/link to Search to ensure all information is picked up.  Migration plans should also be captured to allow for information of legacy systems not be lost.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Archives NZ need to play a stronger regulatory role.  This would require clear legislation, principles, standards, guidelines and support, including clear and simple GDA, and Retention & Disposal, and appraisal process.  Government will also need to provide support (funding) to enable organisations to set up systems to enable this to happen.   Archival silences often occur where information is of a commercially sensitive nature (e.g. tenders, or business solutions) - educate organisations on how to deal with this (e.g. include clause in contract that "at the date of transfer, the business sensitive information is no longer relevant", thus allowing information to be made public).  
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Archives NZ need input into, but not focus on system design.  Need to provide clear requirements for capturing information, i.e. what and how, so organisations can set up their own systems/processes to easily transfer information.  Regulations and monitoring is needed to ensure this happens, and ultimately helps organisations in their "struggle". 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Both.  In-house to support, capture and maintain information in a manner that it is retained and accessible long term.  Consult technical expertise to be stay on top of technical changes and advise/support.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Needs to be a balance.  Although mandatory standards are needed, they need to be clear, easy to follow and doable.  There needs to be some flexibility to allow organisations to retain what is "important for the business" as well.  If too restrictive, you risk engagement.  if not restrictive enough, you risk gaps (archival silences) and losing important aspects of the NZ story.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?
											</h4>
											<div>
												New standards are easy to follow and provides a mechanism to drive accountability.

											</h4>
											<div>
												Many statements in the Discussion Document are open to several interpretations and there is a lot of specialist language.  This is a barrier to engaging with people who are less familiar with the language of the sector.  All New Zealanders should be able to read and understand the intentions of an institution such as Archives New Zealand.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Outreach needs to be specifically resourced.  The UK National Archives recent released their strategy consultation document which included case studies. This would be an ideal way of demonstrating the kind of value that different communities can gain from Archives.  The evidential value of government records in Treaty claims would be a good example.

Much could be made of connecting Archives holdings with the school curriculum, perhaps taking advantage of National Library’s Pond to provide easy access to digitised resources.  

At a physical level, the current building is not well suited to exhibition or education spaces, but being able to physically connect with a collection is important, and makes both the holdings and the institution more real and relevant to people. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Staff need to have a range of skills, particularly around education, technology, outreach and social media. Introducing alternate skill sets and paradigms about information is important, and not the sole domain of the Archivist. 

Making digital content findable directly from Google (rather than having to come through Archway), will make a significant difference.  Although New Zealand is probably too small to implement major Crowdsourcing initiatives, providing options for people to add relevant metadata is crucial to improve findability, and to fill in gaps in what we know about a record.  A good example would be the ability to add a range of Maori metadata or subject headings. Most paper records currently have very little data available to help people identify what the record is.  As a result, we need to rethink who can contribute towards the description of archives and how they do that. 

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												In terms of access, description is a major barrier. In general the archiving and recordkeeping communities are not skilled in appropriately describing or adding relevant metadata to records of interest to Māori. Assistance in what to implement in terms of Māori metadata for public records would be a forward step. 

Archives New Zealand, being an institution of Government, will be a barrier to some. Trust and investment in relationship building is key.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												While agencies know their own information, they are likely to restrict information for too long a period. Much of what is currently restricted needs to be reviewed.  

Agencies need more guidance on valid reasons for restriction, in the same way that there are a limited number of reasons for restricting information under the Official Information Act.  Otherwise access restrictions will be more restrictive than Official Information Act provisions.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												It’s unclear what the problem to be solved is in this question.  Is the issue with the preservation of the data, the retention of what is deemed to be “important” data sets, or the capture of data at a point in time? 

Data extracts and calculations are already often being kept by agencies, as part of the context of the record that they produce.  This practice should be continued and encouraged.  Guidance on keeping this as part of the record would be useful.  Data extracts and analysis may need to be distinguished from “calculations” as defined in GDA7 (1.6) if the expectation is that they should be preserved.

As with preservation formats for other kinds of records, some degree of prescription around suitable data formats for taking point in time snapshots or data extracts would be useful. 

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The answer very much depends on the method of decision making, which is difficult to predict. If the methods involve new kinds of systems for data collection, then (as a high value data source) recordkeeping requirements need to be built in.

An additional approach would be to look at skills development across the recordkeeping workforce around data collection and extraction, harvesting, format migration, preservation, open access, and security, to enable the workforce to make good decisions about how to handle this. 

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Signing off the discharge or transfer of records should be part of the responsibilities of the administrative head/s of the office, as part of the merger or disestablishment of the agency or agencies. 

An Archives staff member should be assigned to work with the agency early on, with a focus on transferring all eligible records to Archives under their existing schedule.  Ideally, this would include a way for agencies to transfer their digital records.  Bear in mind that often staff with the institutional knowledge about the records can leave quickly in change situations, so early intervention is important to identify priorities for records.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes. This should be done as soon as possible. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												It’s unclear what is meant by system design in this question. The statements in the Discussion Document imply design of technical systems.  

If the aim of this focus area is for recordkeeping to be as simple as possible through quality design of technical systems, then a wider definition of what this looks like should be embraced.  Implementing quality systems may include change management, user experience, automated classification, cloud-based systems, governance and exit strategies.  There is also a need to think about a larger technical landscape – how could major technology players help us develop the next generation of information management systems or tools?  

It should be remembered also that at the technical level there are still numerous issues around how to handle legacy systems and email archives that need to be addressed. 

A more useful strategic focus would be on system-wide change across the entire Information landscape of Government.  This includes looking at all the agencies, standards and laws involved in information and data management to gain a whole-of-system view. Aligning the disparate parts of the system is likely to require significant changes to ensure that the kinds of information that we want to be able to keep and access in 40 years is well managed and described now.

There is still a role for recordkeeping regulation – without managing the here and now, we will not collect the records we want to be looking at in 2057. 

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Both in-house and external capability will be needed. Archives needs to employ people with practical experience who can facilitate and coordinate the work of others at the system level. This may require upskilling staff, hiring in, and bringing skills into the country.  It seems unlikely that Archives would ever have the budget to sustain an entirely in-house capability long-term, given the numbers and level of specialist expertise that may be required, and the scarcity of those specialists in New Zealand.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												It should be 100% clear which standards (and aspects of those standards) are mandatory, and for which kind of organisation. Mandatory standards need to take into account the type of organisation to which the standards are being applied.  It may not be reasonable to expect a small rural school to adhere to exactly the same recordkeeping standards as a large Government Organisation.  However, only make mandatory those standards that will support the outcomes that Archives and its stakeholders are looking for.

Some additional standards (such as formats suitable for long-term preservation) should be made mandatory in order to ensure that records can survive to 2057. 

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?
											</h4>
											<div>
												At a strategic level:
-	There is little mention of Archives role to support agencies, except as a regulator.  Information professionals in agencies are both customers and advocates for the work of Archives.  Inadequate support to information professionals will make the strategic focus areas much harder to achieve. 
-	Partnerships with other agencies or organisations with similar goals do not feature in the discussion document. These will be needed to fully achieve the strategic focus areas.
-	There is very little mentioned about how Archives will exercise its leadership role, as mentioned in sections 11(1)a and 11(g) of the Act. Many of the issues that the sector faces, particularly around access and preservation are difficult, but investment and leadership is crucial.  
-	The strategy should reaffirm the importance of the independence of the Chief Archivist.  The Chief Archivist is a role that contributes significantly to the accountability and transparency of government. 
-	Given the forward looking nature of this document, it should be considered how relevant it is to still discuss the “record” in the digital age as something distinct from information or data.  

At an operational level:
-	While a forward focus is good, information professionals are still tackling a legacy of pre-PRA systems that cannot easily be classified and disposed of. Some assistance with addressing legacy issues is required so that we can move forward unencumbered. 
-	With the rate of software format change, 25 years to transfer electronic records is too long.  This needs to be rethought, or a different approach (such as access and management in place at the agency) needs to be designed.

											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Most communities get through the school system somehow. Start teaching people about records/archives, how to access them and why they would need to access them when they are in school (and not just in senior year for history students, the record of government is useful for all sorts). Have an active relationship with the education sector so this can happen. Have staff who can interact on this level.
Hold workshops for community groups on accessing Archives. More outreach.

											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Thinking of the future… if there was a centralised portal to all publicly accessible born digital government records (regardless of where they are stored), work could be done to ensure the information could be interpreted and understood at the central access point. I’m not sure of the logistics of doing this, but records and information management across the government sector would need to be standardised to some extent. Sort of like a Digital NZ web portal, but for the Government record.

											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Currently lack of guidance and practical assistance for iwi in this space. Te Papa have some responsibility for this also, there could be a future partnership between Te Papa, the National Library, Archives New Zealand and iwi groups to develop guidance for management of taonga and to create pathways to accessing taonga looked after by national institutions. 
Traditional ways of managing records and archives are unlikely to meet the needs of Maori (e.g. provenance, original order, control…) so an alternative approach/s should be developed in partnership with iwi to break down barriers and to ensure information is managed and accessible while meeting cultural needs and expectations (e.g. an approach based on the ideas of whakapapa could be brainstormed – similar to provenance, but includes many connection points). An opportunity for innovation in this space.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Con – those closest to the records are more cautious regarding who can and should access them and when, could lead to over restricting. Helps to have a professional archivist guide in this space to enable more objectivity and a professional opinion when deciding on classifications.
Pro – agencies understand the information they create and what it contains, probably better than anyone else.
It should probably be a partnership.

											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												In response to all “How do we ensure important information remains accessible…” questions: I’m not so sure decentralisation will have long term benefits, it’s quite hard to get people to follow standards and the more information we create the more out of control its going to get. The opposite may have better effect - centralise government information management systems (possibly a controversial idea, but I’m sure it could work with the right thinking and investment). 
From a point in time, NZ government and all its agencies could use one central system for BAU document and records management that includes records and archives management and public access capabilities. In such a system all agencies would be responsible for getting information in it and using it for day-to-day business; central government records staff can monitor and support its BAU use and ensure retention and disposal is consistently applied (transfer to Archives NZ could be within the system instead of across systems); and Archives NZ (DIA) can be responsible for maintenance of the system and making sure the information in it can be accessed and understood for as long as its needed. One system would make life a lot easier; no more procurement of systems, transferring, migrating, or closing of systems to worry about; just storage, disposal, a massive file plan, heaps of metadata to maintain, and provision of access. If agencies merge or cease to exist, the information is captured already, so it’s just a case of managing it. Possibly quite ambitious, but I see this working better then decentralisation for various reasons.

											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes, although I consider it quite prescriptive already (for Local Government anyway)
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												If we consider the ‘one system for all’ approach, then ‘yes’ to system design, although its use would need to be regulated once it was live. Would be easier to do as its only one system to control, and you’ll be able to monitor what agencies are doing in that one system. Government regulation will then be more focussed and straightforward. So both are required really.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes, get control – be the experts – assert your expertness. It’s possible that due to funding constraints this may need to be done with/through others, in which case strong partnerships are essential.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Every element of records management that has some risk attached to it should have prescriptive mandatory requirements, e.g. risk of the loss of information, inappropriate access, loss of context, etc. If there is no risk, then the standards could be relaxed somewhat – to best practice guidance.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The opening section of the discussion document states: “Currently we have a role as a regulator of the Public Records Act 2005; a custodian role to care for and protect the records we hold; and a facilitating role around access to the information we hold. We are also expected to have a leadership role in the wider archival sector”. 
This seems to ignore the records Archives New Zealand does not “hold”, like local authority records. Yes, part of “wider archival sector”, but also part of government and subject to the requirements of the Public Records Act. The record of local government should have consideration in the 2057 vision, especially regarding system requirements, storage of records/archives and service delivery. The local government sector would benefit from more regulation in this space as local authority records management is extremely inconsistent across the country. Archives New Zealand needs to make it clear where they stand re: regulation for local government recordkeeping. A question that comes up often is “will you audit us?”, if there is to be no auditing can there at least be plans to put other mechanisms in place to ensure local authorities remain accountable for their records management practice.
One solution: Archives New Zealand could enable local authorities to become “qualified/accredited” in management of records and archives, with those not meeting qualifications being required to become “qualified/accredited” within a certain timeframe (with support from Archives NZ). Level of qualification/accreditation required and time taken to get there could differ depending on the size of the council, responsibilities, and the type/quantity of records/archives held by the council…
See: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/archives-sector/archive-service-accreditation/ for inspiration. Could be a programme of work initially, to assess all Local Authorities, then an ongoing maintenance programme could become BAU.

Review the Public Records Act 2005
Review the List of Protected Records for Local Authorities

Is there going to be a follow up to this method of engagement?To provide feedback to community to explore in more detail the next phase of co-create an action plan to deliver the vision. 

The following should be incorporated into the Regulatory Framework Digital and Data Management Solutions
More advice, guidance on data and digital practices 
Improve on the national training and forums to promote dialogue, exchange of ideas and inform the professional community 
Providing new models of delivery, both physical and digital platforms for linking and integrating access to collections
Data is a record type, there is a lack of any set mandatory standards on how data types should be managed
Resilience 
Address the following:
Project collaboration to support development and developing trends
Evolving new governance models for archival services 
Review the legislation – Public Records Act 2005 – there are significant gaps and corrections to the audit programme that need to be in place if Archives NZ wants to support this vision
Improve capability for professionally leading in digital data field
Include local government into audit programme
Collaboration and partnerships 
Address the following:
Supporting both regional and thematic partnerships 
Working with partners beyond the archives sector to support collections development 
Collaborate with academic, business sectors, community heritage sector, archival trusts and independent establishments

Archives NZ is expected to lead and be a national leader.Don't lead through others.

Drive Information, Records and Data Intelligence
Address the following:
Collecting robust, nationally collated data for trend analysis and providing up to date advice
Exploiting qualitative and quantitative data to enable evidence-based outcomes and business cases
Using advocacy tools, such as case studies and campaigns, to make business cases

More Archives NZ training and seminars on offer, these have been peeled back or have refocused to lunch time sessions in Wellington. 
Bring back the forums and have Archives New Zealand staff conduct training.
Provide and promote advice and expertise within the born-digital environment and electronic working.
Use the market place to promote collection such as using “apps”. (Think of clever ways to promote – people sightsee, they go online to find info on places they visit, link in the Archives wealth of info into this unexplored channel.
Use more user friendly demos, training, online guides rather than documents to assist users. Use video media, future wise 3D presentations.

											<div>
												Agency may not be fully informed of privacy requirements. Thus setting incorrect access restrictions. Even though they know their business.
Roles change, staff come and go, and are from different skill sets and experience background. This has a result on how well access is set.
No peer review or checking in place.
Corrective actions on inaccurate access restrictions may occur years later of when challenged, complained about or publically exposed.
Create a more of a hybrid relationship between Archives NZ and the agency, making Archives NZ act like a portfolio manager with additional responsibilities for access status classifications.
Strengthen/establish a partnership on peer review with Privacy Commissioner and Government Chief Privacy Officer.
Strengthen privacy roles and responsibilities across agencies.

There are gaps in mandatory standards that need to provide standardised “spelling out” of requirements.

												I have difficulty accepting a change to digitisation without first solving the Public Records Act compliance issues. To use an anecdote, the Defence force Archive material held at Archives and submitted by returned persons to the National collections is among some of the richest research material despite the sector's need for withholding information until otherwise permissed. Yet I have been told of an anecdote where a government department had to second a TSS clearance holder to sort certain offshore records. Record making and keeping, whether it is Intel, anecdotes for welfare or asset and financial data, is taught progressively in the military, at least in my sojourn, and I don't understand why it is not a competency on which a promotion or passage offshore to represent what is meant to be our best depends. I don't think my feedback gossip and it was discussed in a group without names, it is not intended to be hurtful but point out the skill and knowledge gaps the taxpayer may not be pleased with and in fact, really are not tolerable.

											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												One does not have a real need for archives without topic curiosity or settler ancestry. I think this rolls to change in the next ten years as the WW2 settler wave rolls to the archive record as unrestricted,  there is nought to do about it. 
Perhaps to get young people interested they could teach use of Archives NZ resources as portion of research papers at university. I have advanced proficiency in both qualitative and quantitative research duly deemed so by a NZ university yet my first encounter with Archives came much after my apparent honours status, this is not correct.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												In some ways there is room, I think, for archives to move to cultural-historical advisory. I explain this by way of anecdote...a book I privately sold to one of the Archives staff members on how New Zealanders historically wrote about science is, if one is doing early period research, an archival use enabling resource. The book was 1960s, or thereabouts, and therefore could do with a rewrite by those with knowledge of how to navigate pedagogical and ontological changes that changed writing. There are the small sector guides made but, for example,  if one is brand new to archives and say mental health and doesn't know PTSD is a recent diagnosis, one could come to the conclusion we had no sufferers prior to recent conflicts.
My like of paper records is not simply nostalgia, paper will always have a place in many sectors and this should be acknowledged and championed, one can guess that while we use sophisticated systems in our current conflicts, material such as our own or foreign 'theater' based propaganda not only has more nostalgia, realism but also monetary gains with regard to holdings. In this regard, needs and directions for departments should be panel based and consultative and include the public.  I for one would prefer we hold items not just of national significance, but that public holdings are the premier holdings in terms of research and monetary value, museum and exhibition crossover.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I have an instance where I have asked land care research to amend the historical swamp record in Kumeu to reflect a Crown article in Papers Past on the railway swamp draining in Kumeu in the 1800s. I don't know the inner workings of any treaty settlement on either side in that area, I do not have Maori ties, the information was always public, I added it to add for all. Now that most treaty grievances are, some will disagree, resolved, topical interest and ancestors, the same as all, will be the draw cards.  
Again, teaching archive use at university will aid this.
I don't think that I can comment though on the digitisation of Taonga in terms of protocol, I just think that iwi should be given the right to set interaction and copyright/reproduction standards, in consultation with normal vetting, when applicable.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I almost can't believe this is being asked, some say Coors, such as Defence, are sacrosanct. This should be done by a centralised vetting panel, I know of an instance where someone's personal view, despite a committee decision access didn't require some oversight, has resulted in delays.
I think the police destruction policy should be reformed to require living relative permission for the destruction of coroner related investigation files. This, in my experience, will prevent gross injustices, recall the Black Widow, and enable victims to inform police processes, such as amendments to child interview techniques and after care.

Sitting in the reading room, which is a generally quiet well disciplined space, I once overheard a foreigner have a discussion with an archivist about his research on a politician requiring said politician's office permission should he wish to go further. It was Peter Dunne, the interested person, Chinese. I think that our oversight and traceability in the system is sufficient yet given that one isn't trained in archive use for university study of politics, perhaps archivists could have some training in red flags and escalating them. I do not know that digitisation would resolve this unless it is using RealMe only and an inbuilt system of monitoring deployed

												As a user of Archives NZ and some restricted files I think many departmental contacts are unaware they hold the point of contact position, are to slow to respond to enable research, are sometimes wrong contacts as discussed on your site and some are not responsive to an archivist user's request in that questions arrive in an unfamiliar format, they are not trained to respond or understand what I need, and this is a disservice and caveat for decentralisation.

												Overall the strategic focus areas outline a future where the public records is integral to the wider information eco-system an ensures the function of the Chief Archivist is relevant to a modern information creation, information seeking, and information using society. It's especially important that the regulatory mechanism are in place to support the necessary shifts required to achieve this future - and this is the significant opportunity that the Public records Act, and the role of the Chief Archivist provides.

											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												To inspire diversity of use, the national archival institution has to also be diverse and flexible in its thinking, its understanding of the range of information seeking behaviours and its ability to embrace new uses for information. Importantly, information is more valuable when joined up with other units of information to address questions and help understand our past - one of the ways in which you could inspire diversity of use is get the hell out of the way - have system and processes that remove interventions to use. Shift your status as gatekeeper of knowledge to enabler of use and reuse.

											</h4>
											<div>
												It's very important to understand archival silences in order to have an informed debate about whether they should be filled, and more importantly, who fills them. It's important for Archives NZ to understand its limitation with archival silences. If Archives NZ is the memory of government, then it can only address gaps in the national documentation through this perspective, unless it boosts its role as a national archival coordinator.

												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?

												Standards only work if they are implemented. Whichever approach is necessary to ensure implementation is preferred.

												How would you describe yourself?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Recordkeeping/information management professional

											<h4>
												We have questions on each strategic focus area, but if you want to provide a general comment only, please do so here.
											</h4>
											<div>
												Overall there is good strategic direction outlined. We would like to see more about: 'unconventional' records e.g social media, websites etc.; what local Government should be keeping; potential changes around working in post treaty settlement world; how we ensure the strategy is maintained through political changes; how the public will access information in the future - e.g. if devolved responsibility should we have one central portal to access information; as it is not just record keeping professionals involved in maintaining good records how to ensure good practice is carried out by all necessary staff;  the continuing need for good storage, access of and experienced staff to maintain physical records - feel the p.5 statement down plays the importance of these historical documents; 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Must be continuous and ongoing - active promotion that targets particular groups.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Trained staff - need both archival understanding (and understanding of 'their' collections, and excellent technical understanding; excellent metadata
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Suitable repositories; knowledge of best practice; trust in the systems; to be able to uphold cultural beliefs to ensure preservation in an ever changing and  highly technical world 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												As long as each agency has a designated, experienced person to ensure that best practice is maintained - a danger would exist that it is just left to technical experts, and responsibility devolved around the organisation.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Needs an overall control - e.g from Archives NZ, that has a means of monitoring compliance and standards, not just setting standards and assuming they will be followed
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Should be above political whims - has an independent authority.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Needs an overall control - e.g from Archives NZ, that has a means of monitoring compliance and standards, not just setting standards and assuming they will be followed
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Definitely. There needs to be an agency that takes overall responsibility or the risk of information management being ignored, negated or lost through negligence. Particulary in tough economic times
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Needs to marry the two - stand along side each other.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Definitely. This is a NZ wide issue and the Government needs to commit to maintaining good records for now and into the future.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												There needs to a level of mandatory requirements to ensure that information is not lost. Also need the means to ensure the requirements are met.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?

											<div>
												See notes on pg 1 of survey.
