											</h4>
											<div>
												No response
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Outreach - trained, archivally literate speakers talking to different user groups - speakers who know how to adapt the message for different groups. Getting to know the diverse communities. Taking the initiative, going to groups not waiting for them to come to you - developing a programme of visits. Developing guides in multiple formats, languages and presentations the diverse communities can relate to.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Using systems that are straightforward to navigate - using users for testing before going live. Developing more tools that explain how archives are arranged and how to access them - particularly those that are not yet digitised - tools such as the administrative histories of government departments. There is useful information in appraisal reports that users of those records would find of assistance. Employment of more trained archivists who know and understand the records they manage and are therefore able to assist users. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Barriers are generally barriers for all not specifically for Maori - need for good communication, good descriptions of records, clear understanding of any access restrictions, systems that have been user-tested and are easy to use. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Pro: Agencies are perhaps more aware of sensitivity of information BUT
Cons: agencies do not usually see the big picture - do not necessarily understand the longer term use of records beyond the reasons for which they were originally created. A tendency to want to protect information rather than make it available.  
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Question is rather obscure.  It must be accepted by agencies that ANZ has the ultimate control. This is more difficult with the current status of the Chief Archivist. There is a need for close involvement with records keepers but also for there to be high level (CEO) meetings. Provisions are there in the Act - they should be enforced.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												ANZ's role is to ensure records are still created and that agencies accept and implement good records keeping practices. ANZ must work with agencies to understand what is happening in the decision-making arena and planning accordingly.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												All of the questions in this section come back to the role ANZ plays with agencies.  There must be an understanding of what is happening with mergers and closures, and a recognition that the records may be taken over as of right by ANZ. If a private company is involved provision must be made for continuing access to records and the eventual deposit with ANZ. A process should be developed  to ensure systems superseded by mergers or closures are taken over by ANZ.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												ANZ can already set this out - it is part of the Public Records Act, records can only be destroyed with ANZ's approval. The Act also specifies that records are to be created.  This is where close liaison with agencies becomes imperative.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												These two work hand in hand - regulation has to be there but it needs to work alongside system design but design should not drive retention decisions. ANZ needs to have cross government knowledge, the ability to advise but also to be trusted to advise knowledgeably, to build up connections with agencies, to have staff who are able to talk credibly with agencies about systems and who are seen as useful, credible advisers.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Both are needed - not either/or.  Without in-house capability and a knowledge of what is being developed outside  it would be less easy for ANZ to be credible when working with agencies.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The setting of standards by professionals is imperative. Voluntary standards are extremely difficult to police. However there should also be some degree of flexibility to cater for unusual circumstances.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>

												Devolution of access to agencies is fraught with problems. Providing access to their records is not what agencies are set up for - it is not a core activity. They have neither the reading room space nor the staff to handle inquiries.  Generally agencies are not particularly open in their release of information - having worked in departments handling OIA requests it becomes apparent that less is best. Changing this would be an uphill battle.  For researchers having to visit each agency  to access material would be time consuming and frustrating. With material held by ANZ much can be achieved in one place. An "all of government" system may help to overcome such issues if ANZ had automatic access to it and if it was set so restrictions could prevent sensitive material being seen.
It is disappointing that there is little elaboration on and  no questions about relating to the wider communities - local bodies, community archives etc. A feel for how ANZ is going to manage this part of its mandate under the Act would have been useful.
Funding for managing the electronic future and employing staff to ensure these records are created may also be an issue. It is important that this exercise raises these questions in such a way that funding is adequately addressed.

												The discussion document contains complex concepts and a lot of industry-specific terminology that many people would struggle to understand without an industry background. Ideally this document would be written so that it could be understood by a general audience. The interests of all sectors need to be represented and all information management roles ought to understand that this document is applicable and relevant to them. For example the term 'archives' is narrowly understood. An alternative might be to refer to 'information' and 'information management' as opposed to 'archives' and 'archivists'. Also the continued reference to 'records of government' implies that this discussion document (and subsequent strategy) is applicable to central government agencies only.

												Introduce the relevance and importance of records and archives in the school curriculum from year one and continue this throughout the stages of education. Children and young people should be sourcing and using records and archives as they learn and progress from primary school to high school and beyond. Educate the educators by building it into teacher training.

												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Archives NZ needs to grow its capacity to include the expertise needed to support the preservation of born-digital information and access to it for the people of New Zealand. Empowering the regional offices to assist local populations to navigate and access digital information is pivotal. The focus of this question is somewhat misleading: helping people navigate access to information is not solely the preserve of archivists nor is the information limited to archival records.

												Archives NZ needs to adopt a strategy that considers agencies to be interdependent rather than separate entities. The way in which we interact is now through multi-agency collaboration – everything from central government agencies sharing vital information on vulnerable children (set out in legislation) through to how we conduct our national (and international) research in teams that span organisations, sectors and nationalities. The lines are blurred in terms of being able to ascertain to which entity the information belongs, and who will be responsible for its preservation and accessibility.

											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												If Archives NZ does not take on this role, then who will? The archival silences would surely grow greater if there was not one body governing and setting parameters around this in a consistent manner.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Both are important. On the latter, the crux of the strategy working effectively into the future is ‘good system design’. The majority of high value information within agencies now resides in large line-of-business systems – systems that are in the main chosen, implemented and supported by IT professionals (and related external consultants and vendors) with little or no input from other information professionals. Unless that culture is able to be changed (through regulation perhaps) then this strategy cannot be realised.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Archives NZ would ideally partner with leaders in the industry (e.g.: vendors and IT professionals). Archives NZ should also ensure that this strategy is firmly aligned with other relevant national strategies, such as the Government ICT Strategy and Action Plan.  Both would allow Archives NZ to influence the development and design of the technologies that will be used to manage information in the future.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The focus ought to be on a small set of clear and critical mandatory requirements so as to allow agencies to carry out their business functions whilst also ensuring that achievable compliance requirements can be met. The notion of ‘letting the system do the work’ in the strategy will only work if there are a set of clearly defined and achievable mandatory requirements. There will always be a place for both mandatory and discretionary standards, however Archives NZ will need to acknowledge that voluntary standards or ‘aspirational requirements’ are unlikely to be met in organisations with competing compliance requirements due to financial constraints.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Archives NZ needs to be better resourced in order to provide access to digital information. Only a very small portion of archives have been digitised by Archives NZ and made available online, and in addition there is a significant backlog of description work to be completed. The net result of this is that a large proportion of information that resides at Archives NZ is digitally inaccessible and/or not discoverable until such time as its existence has been made known online. This does not encourage agencies to transfer information into the custody of Archives NZ.

												•	By enabling people to see their history is a powerful tool.  ANZ has already made a number of resources available digitally (e.g.war records) which have given people access to touch-points in their family’s or this country’s history.  Fiji National Archives’ Director, Opeta Alefaio, recently gave a presentation on the issues they had faced and how they were engaging their communities with archives.  They have run an extensive preservation-driven digitisation programme and this has enabled them to mount outreach programmes (roadshows) using both digital material and physical surrogates where electricity is not available.

											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?

											<div>
												•	By partnering with other digital repositories to join the dots with cross-linking – for example, Auckland Museum’s Online Cenotaph is able to link to a portrait in the ANZ collections, but not to the digitised war record for the individual.  A link in the opposite direction would enable people to go from the public record to an interactive space where they can add to the broader record.

There is no quick fix for either of these issues – ongoing dialogue is needed.

											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												•	It could be argued (in favour) that agencies need to be able to determine whether something is in such an early stage of discussion that it would be counter-productive to release information lest it generate a storm over something which is unlikely to move beyond the brainstorming stage. 
•	It could equally be argued (against) that the public should be aware of the full context of the decision-making process
•	There is a danger that, left to their own devices, agencies might set their classifications in such a way as to obscure some aspects of their activities.

												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												•	Up to a point.  I think we need an agreed definition of “the record of government” so that prescriptive measures are not applied too broadly.
With the capacity issues identified in the document related to the expected growth in physical storage needs, perhaps it is time to review the question of what is meant by “the enduring record of government” and therefore whose records must be transferred to Archives NZ.  Agencies such as universities are government-funded, but their activities are not about the operation of government, and it is in their own interest to keep an enduring record of their activities.  Transfers of archives from agencies in this position have the effect of adding to ANZ’s storage burden, while removing the archives from the agency most likely to require access.
Instead of a time-frame for requiring access from such agencies, and a deferral process, perhaps Archives NZ should look at requiring them to offer ANZ only such material as fits within the definition of the enduring record and which is being considered for disposal.  

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I believe that quality guidance around system design would be a valuable contribution ANZ could make.  Systems which are highly prescriptive are a difficult sell for RMs, but systems designed with inbuilt flexibility to be able both to respond to the particular organisation and reflect its role as an agency of government would have the potential to assist in developing better organisational practices.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I believe the expertise to assist with system design would be better developed within Archives NZ.  Record keeping systems need to be developed with a proper understanding of the record keeping continuum and the knowledge-base to hear and fully understand the record keeping needs of the organisation.  The danger of working through others is that the lack of that understanding will lead to “talking past each other” and build systems which do not do what they need to do.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The paper notes that record-keeping maturity among public offices remains disappointing 10 years after the PRA.  
I believe short-term thinking in government is a significant contributor to this problem.  In an environment which is constantly being re-structured, record-keeping becomes even more of a challenge than usual: it is difficult to embed a good recordkeeping culture when roles are insecure, responsibilities are moved around and little or no handover capacity is factored into changes.  Organisational culture takes a very long time to change and settle and good record keeping requires more than just compliance-level commitment from senior managers.  Assistance with embedding good record keeping attitudes in senior managers of government agencies would be a good starting point to developing the culture within organisations. 

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Just to echo some of my earlier more general comments: maybe Archives NZ needs to look at the record of government like a series of concentric circles.  Agencies involved in the machinery of government would sit at the centre with the highest level of prescriptiveness; agencies (such as universities) responsible to government but not a part of its operation would have the flexibility to operate within guidelines of good practice, with transfer to Archives NZ as a back-up option rather than a requirement which causes inconvenience to both parties.

												My impression is that the work of  Archives New Zealand is currently and in the past has been significantly handicapped by under-resourcing. Without a significant increase in resources I do not see how ANZ will be able to look after its physical holdings and at the same time properly meet the challenges posed by masses of digital records.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>

												I am not sure what this question means.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Whatever system of decision-making is used there will or at least should be a clear physical/digital document trail. New decision-making methods will require government agencies and Archives NZ to establish what is the material that needs to be retained and eventually made accessible. If this is not done it is impossible to properly assess government actions
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Whenever agencies merge or cease to exist it must be clear that the relevant chief executives are responsible for ensuring that their obligations under the Public records Act are met.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes. In most cases only Archives NZ will be aware of such gaps and will be the only body with an interest in and mandate to address such archival silences. Government agencies will only know what they hold and will generally not know or care how their records relate to the records of other agencies.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												It needs to do both. Without regulation and oversight records that should be kept will for a variety of reasons be lost. Good system design if of course critical, but is by itself not sufficient.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?

											<h4>

												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?

											<div>
												Archives NZ needs to reach out to people other than professionals and genealogists.  Suggest participating, or creating a community event of interest to other demographics - such as a school or university.  How about making a documentary for TV - or partner with a well-known commercial entity for joint recognition and advertising?  Your website needs improvement.  It needs to be more welcoming for non-professional people that Archives NZ wishes to inspire to use the records of government.  The user interface needs some work.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Archives NZ could supply a nationally approved metadata template so that contributors can ensure their records have sufficient “tags” and also need to ensure that Archway has exceptional search functionality with an easy user interface.  Users may know little about what they are looking for - OR may know a lot and want to be very prescriptive about what they are searching for.  
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Just like other groups in the community, Maori may need to be made aware that information relating to their culture/heritage is available through Archives NZ.  You also need to encourage them to hand it over.  Access should be made easy for both physical and digital access – need good search functionality in both languages.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												It would be an extra overhead for both the agency and Archives NZ to manage access classifications per agency.  As part of the template for the ingestion of any records there should be guidelines for record types with set time frames – e.g. People identifiers = 100 years.  An organisation needs to feel secure about their records but consistency is less resourceful.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The only way our information can remain accessible is to ensure there is sufficient and accurate metadata on every record – and that additional links can be managed/added – but never any removed.  Datasets must have links to the records that provided this data.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												As per above response
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Records must remain with the collection where the record was created.  Metadata relationship links may guide a researcher to or from a parent or affiliated agency.  Frameworks should exist showing relationships and dates of cessations, merges, splits etc.  This also applies to agencies that collaborate to produce records.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Absolutely yes – but only for high value records.  Archives should be able to stipulate timeframes - and do (as per transfer requirements in a GDA).  However, an organisation should also be able to deem their records as having high interest/value.
Regarding any obvious “archival silences” Archives NZ should contact the relevant government agency to request transfer of these records.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Perhaps not “shift” as much as “widen”.  
It may be highly beneficial for Archives NZ to be able to provide advice or suggestions to any companies developing systems that create or capture government records, information and content.  Agencies may be happy to pay for guidance as they implement a new system so that they can be sure they have achieved best practice and can obtain PRA compliance.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes (as above).  A technical expert, proven in this field, could be a great revenue source for Archives NZ.  Wouldn't it be great to influence system design!
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The new standard is realistic and achievable but can lead to some wide interpretation.  By being more prescriptive executive management can recognise the requirements by clear examples.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?
											</h4>
											<div>
												 In the very near future Archives NZ needs to be in a position to accept bulk uploads of digital born records ( and also those compliantly digitised) as some government agencies are holding large amounts premium records over ten years.

  It is hoped that well before 2057 we are in an “all of government” digital word with one authenticator and secure access to everything official about ourselves in one place.  Consistent metadata must be used from one source - like one central locator database.  As this becomes closer to being a reality Archives NZ must be involved so that Government is managing our records right from creation to the end of their lifecycle.

 Putting a line in the sand for Archives NZ to only accept digital born records?  
This is ambitious for the near future.  There are still instances where businesses and individuals will find this challenging.  It is positive planning – but is it realistic?

											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?

												Awareness of what Archives NZ actually does still seems limited by the wider public, especially the difference between Archives NZ and the National Library.

												Discoverability will always be underpinned by a sound standards based structure.  Ensuring a an element of consistency around how the wider public sector captures and manages information will still have currency in future.  Additional methods of identifying information on top of the sound consistent framework (standards based) only furthers the ability to discover information and making it more relevant to end users (who are often the subject matter experts in the first place)

												A potential upside to this is organisations may not feel bound by regulatory requirements as much and can make access status decisions in support of their core function.  Essentially so long as the desired result is understood an organisation an approach it however they like.
However, inconsistency across similar information types between government agencies could be counter productive.  In my experience it is generally easier to adopt a clear and consistent 'rule' as it allows clear benchmarking by an organisation of it's performance against agreed to and consistent expectations of Government.  This is especially important when public organisations undergo significant structural change, as the core function of the organisation may remain unchanged but the roles and people performing those roles, are in comparison, relatively fluid.

												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Clear and active regulator.  Significant increase in 'real' support to public organisations on the ground e.g.  Public organisation can engage Archives NZ almost like a consultant for a defined period to assist develop Information Management.  This approach could complement the strategy of managing archive information consistently from the point of capture/creation by ensuring there is a common sense check with Archives NZ when developing new business systems etc.  While there may currently be an expectation that organisations are referring to requirements under the various mandatory standards adopted by Archives NZ, one wonders how true that really is when Archives NZ identifies "“disappointing” levels of recordkeeping maturity among public offices 10 years after the Public Records Act came into effect."   This in part requires an acknowledgement that not all public organisations are based in Wellington and that actual, hands on support may be useful in a world where archive repositories may  in fact be de-centralised and managed by a wider group than archives NZ
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Active regulation, which means more engagement using better regulation rather than more regulation.  The method of decision making should not overly affect the end result if Archives NZ mandate and strategy is clear, accepted and given the opportunity to embed for a reasonable amount of time.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												not hving been involved in this scenario I am not sure to waht degree archives NZ is involved already, but one possible approach  would be for Archives NZ once notified of the closure or merger to engage early with the affected organisation.  Archives NZ could perhaps go one step further than communicating expectations, but assign a 'Transition Specialist' will actually be available onsite at the affected organisation for a period of time leading up to and including the transition period to advise and ensure archival considerations are included.  I guess it would be a similar approach to an HR existing procedure but would allow an amount of specialist consistency through the transition period at a time when the organisations staff may be dis-engaged of simply not interested.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes I would agree.  However any impact on the ability to store transferred archives or indeed support the ability of public organisations, not only through guidance but financial assistance, to consistently manage archival material in a de-centralised model.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes.   Identification of defined record types from other documentation is often an after thought.  Especially records classes which are clearly required to me maintained indefinitely can be managed as such from the point of creation.  My experience is working with Information Technology led projects in designing and implementing systems that may end up being record repositories, is that the emphasis is often on implementing something that is technically simple, cheaply and that benefits ends users.  Regulatory requirements are not widely considered as they are seen to add complexity and hinder what end users want.  In my own situation a gap still exists between a generally well funded IT department and the perceived value of managing content in a structured way at the point content is created/captured rather it being something the Records Manager can sort out later.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Absolutely.  Publication of standards and communication only go so far as interpretation of those standards are not consistent.  An example was the old Electronic Recordkeeping Metadata Standard which was all but indecipherable to most IT professionals I engaged with on.  I would be the first to admit my skills are not from a technical perspective, and theirs was not from a content driven, regulatory perspective - bridging that gap often proved difficult.  Archives NZ developing in house capability to assist organisations bridge that gap would be useful but again it probably requires that 'on the ground' engagement referred to previously.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												If a standard is issued by Archives NZ it should be mandatory so long as Archives NZ is an active regulator.  Where an organisation is not compelled to meet a standard, the fact that meeting that voluntary standard is likely to be a cost to the organisation would count against it when that organisation looks at allocating resource to something it may not deem as it's core function? While I may not agree with this s I would argue good information governance and management allows and supports an organisation to undertake it's core function, resource is often provided to under ensure that supporting role to occur adequately.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?

											<div>
												One thing didn't specifically comment on as I was not sure where to do that, was in relation to Archives NZ taking a leading role across the South Pacific.  The assumed environmental changes are potentially significant so helping establish some resilience around this is great.

												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?

											<div>
												There still seems to be a silo mentality across government, whilst I respect that Government departments should self determine their archives there seems to be a gap in Archives New Zealand providing the advice, and that advice being taken on within departments. This is not Archives New Zealand's fault, I see it partly that you are too buried inside Internal Affairs to be taken seriously, AND Information and Records Managers aren't always acknowledged for their expertise within central (and local for that matter) government.

What I'm referring to is a "joined up government" with archives as a service to coin a modern vernacular…

Success has been seen inside internal affairs with the Real Me project and I think it's this approach that I'd like to see pervade archives and recordkeeping across the CG/LG sector. This could extend to "information management as a service" and perhaps has a better vernacular given the connotation archives can have for some people.

Another way to inspire and reuse (as is mandated in Government) is to lead by example and showcase key research collections.  An area dear to my heart is access and outside your partnerships with the Mormons, and the servicemans' records I think your approach to this has been inadequate overall.  At the very least it's been inefficient and taxpayers money in the case of the latter has been squandered.  Happy to back that up.

All the above relates to the public getting better access, better ways to deal with government any time of the day or night and from anywhere inside New Zealand or even across the globe. I believe Archives New Zealand should spearhead and lead the charge to get appropriate funding to facilitate this.  Instead it appears to be using lack of funding as an excuse not to do it.

												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												You have made it clear that you will be upgrading archway but in the meantime there is no reason why you cannot provide better online services - even from other tools such as enhancing The Community Archive for example or third-party software in the interim.

Offering (Records/)Information Management as a Service.

Offering Digital Preservation as a Service.

Better Online Services as discussed above.  Particulalry for Audiovisual viewing.

Scaled up digitisation to link heritage records to their modern counterparts to provide context. (Context as a Service?!)

Digitise your indexes and finding aids.  Enhance discoverability by improving metadata which will make serendipitous discovery better too.

Scale up your RK Advice service to a modern Ask an Archivist service - like some Public Libraries offer.

Maintain a regional presence with expert advisers available in the 4 main centres.  You could supplement by conducting (at least) annual regional workshops on how to best use your (online) resources.

											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The same as the all kiwis/users from a technical perspective.

Recommend you adopt a more consultative approach – as we discovered in the Kermadecs situation this is a method the entire Government could improve on.

Recognise the old traditions, and scale up your capability for oral histories, and videos online, with appropriate other cultural and heritage resources digitised to provide context.

The language of archives does not sit comfortably inside the context of turangawaewae.  Some work required here perhaps.

Similarly Archives New Zealand is probably Eurocentric in its thinking, and it’s interesting to juxtapose this with whether one kiwi group - versus a group of representatives, can speak for all. 

Does Archives NZ work alongside Iwi agencies across Government? - I don't see it when thinking through Maori Land Court/TPK etc but that doesn't mean it isn't happening.  Clearly there are benefits to all kiwis if you did.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I see value in letting them do this BUT Archives NZ being the arbitrator or wrangler AND publishing and working to a framework to give agencies control.  This can be contestable by agencies - and by Archives NZ audit - but keep it simple.
 

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												If only reports are retained, or decisions, how do we ensure appropriate 'supporting documentation' is retained?  Archives NZ has to set guidelines or a framework, and perhaps audit processes too.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												As above re- 'supporting documentation'.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												We should provide an 'orphanarium' approach where records lacking context, or when a agency ceases to exist, means the records are appraised and go to Archives NZ (rather than the tip!!).
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Clearly a leadership and guidance role for Archives NZ ... and no doubt a policing or auditing role.  Is the PRA and its associated guidelines granular enough?
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												No.  To be effective you need to be outcomes focused.

I have discussed this with colleagues at our organisation (in response to NLNZ's recent survey) and we all believe 'virtue' for recordkeeping and archiving should be an easy thing - a bit like the approach IRD takes.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												No to both!  Stay outcome focused.  You are the guardian after all!
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Again aim for the virtuous approach like IRD does - let agencies see the benefit in what they do as evidence of good governance, good business - for today and for future kiwis.  There is a natural tension between cramping people's style through being too prescriptive (the Archivists' Way, some might say) versus being very easy to comply/virtuous.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Two surveys to 'related' audiences in the past 3 months with Archives and National Library of NZ - both wings of the Department of Internal Affairs.  One wonders if in 2057 the three agencies will be joined up or there will be more need than ever for autonomy and clarity of purpose.  Perhaps the born digital era; the information age, will decide that for us.  I look forward to contributing again in about 2025 or 2030 which is a more realistic horizon in my opinion.  

Good luck in your search for maintaining relevance and purpose in the very important role you currently undertake for maintaining and providing access to the record of the New Zealand's government .... New Zealand is quite simply the best place in the world to live not just because of our environment but also because of the lack of corruption, the separation of judiciary and Government and the ethics of our people.  Thank you to all in Archives NZ, and DIA, for your part in that.

											<div>
												Inspiring engagement in history is probably the first step to engaging more from communities in a sustainable manner. Liaise more with DIA Ethnic Communities, attend their events; proactively engage with stakeholders who are traditionally underrepresented in user groups of archives.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?

											<div>
												Have easier to use and navigate systems that use more up to date technology. Be more active and push engagement diverse groups. Design online tutorials on how to use the current systems or around FAQs.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Barriers are systemic and from multiple points. Economic barriers and sustained alienation of Maori rights and entitlements means that the barrier to higher for Maori than for some other groups. Engagement with key iwi is important to breaking down some of these barriers over time, but so is finding a way to engage disenfranchised Maori. There is no easy or quick win.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Pros: They do (generally) know the content of their records.
Cons: They don't always listen to expert advice given on appropriate access conditions, this can cause confusion for researchers when one agency has something open and another has it restricted. 
Consistency of access conditions is one of the largest cons.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Ensure that appraisal methodologies change to keep pace with the changing nature of the way Govt info is created and decision making is done. For example, are we currently ensuring that the algorithms used to mine "big data" and make decisions are captured sufficiently in the public archive? Do we, and researchers, even have the technical ability to interrogate and discover the biases in the algorithms that influenced Govt decisions? 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												There are always new methods of decision making, but ANZ needs to ensure that it is both general enough and specific enough in its recordkeeping monitoring to ensure a sufficient record is maintained and accessible. ANZ should probably be more directive around ensuring that agencies are complying with ss43 and 44 of the PRA.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												ANZ should probably be more directive around ensuring that agencies are complying with ss17, 18, 43 and 44 of the PRA.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes. ANZ needs to be clear about what records it thinks are important for the long term the NZ govt and citizens. ANZ should also be clear with citizens and govt that long term is not the same as something becoming an archive eventually.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												No. Good RK regulation includes informing system design. ANZ input on system design does currently happen, but in a more ad hoc manner than is probably desirable. More direct engagement with agencies on how their systems are designed and interact with each other is important, but ANZ is currently not resourced with the appropriate capability to do this, so it will require upskilling and recruitment targeted to this area. Mandatory standards can assist with this, but without monitoring of these standards and ensuring compliance with them it will not make change.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes to both. Some inhouse capacity ANZ's ability should assist in influencing others.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The new standard is a good iterative step in the development of standards at ANZ. Having a proliferation of standards that are not developed together can cause issues. There is a place for both mandatory and voluntary standards in the framework, but I think they both need to be use with discretion. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>

												In mergers, surely the "new" agency inherits the records from it's predecessor. If the agency ceases to exist ( eg CERA ) the Archives NZ must be given the ability / resources to take control of all records that agency and process them as it sees fit.

											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												No. As a government agency, Archives NZ are the ultimate authority on what is required to ensure the "record of the nation". You should be prescribing what is required to do , and leaving the industry to come up with systems that will allow that to happen. To become involved in system design would negate ( to some extent ) your ability to provide independent influence in this area.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Remote digital interactions about born-digital or digitized archives offers greater equality of access and longer reach for Archives' expert staff.  Resources need to be gradually diverted from reading rooms, though some residual provision will always be necessary.   
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Māori face all the access barriers that other groups and individuals experience.  The unique problem facing Māori is the weakness and, often, absence of fundamental descriptive and metadata layers in archive and current records.  This makes identification of information of value to iwi, hapū and whanau difficult.  Archives New Zealand should focus on this barrier in its own holdings and, as a regulator, in the current record of government.    
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												It is right that the heat of accountability for access decisions is applied to government agencies.  Access classifications are made by agencies in consultation with the Chief Archivist and in light of the Chief Archivist's standards.  This is sufficient influence, and it could be enhanced by the routine publication of the Chief Archivist's views on access decisions.    
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												A full and accurate record of government must include visibility of the machinery of decision making, be it human or automated.  The Chief Archivist's mandate to set standards can be used to specify how agencies should document their processes in an accessible and comprehensible way.  
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Accessibility by design is the goal.  A mandatory PRA standard should be set for accessibility and reported on.  An accessibility expectation should be built into all-of-government common capabilities.  The PRA accessibility default (open and accessible at 25 years, whether in Archives or agency) should be integrated with public information about OIA, LGOIMA and Privacy Act.  
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												A comprehensive map of the information assets that make up the record of government is a necessary foundation for keeping track of maintaining that information during administrative change.  This does not yet exist and should be developed and maintained.  Archives should use its influence as an independent regulator and as part of DIA to ensure PRA considerations are a core component of machinery of government and legislative change guidance.  
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The PRA in its current form supports wider consultation about what is kept.  Archives should become more active and directive in the consultation that informs the development of retention and disposal schedules.  Agencies currently often fail to identify key stakeholder groups and undertake narrow and perfunctory consultation.  Consultation should be supported by a clear and, if possible, enduring acquisition policy from Archives.  A supporting approach would be to develop government- or sector-wide schedules so that consultation on what is to be kept moves beyond departmental and portfolio silos.   
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes, there should be stronger influence, indeed direction, in system design.  Compulsory adoption of common capabilities and systems should be pursued, in combination with other DIA mandates, notably GCIO.  
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Both are necessary. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												A coherent and accessible record of government will not achieved without making the core requirements mandatory.  A voluntary standard is just guidance.  
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The record of government is in poor shape after a generation of rapid and haphazard shifts to digital information management.  Technology, policy and process innovation has led to major improvements in government services, but has usually failed to manage the underlying information effectively.  The increasing ease of creation of digital information has coincided with a period where core bureaucratic skills in managing paper information were increasingly redundant and lost, without being replaced by rules for the digital age.  Similarly, long-term information preservation is seldom designed into systems.  The extent of the mess is not fully known, but current indications are worrying.  It may be that the best strategy has two streams.  One is to leap to an improved common approach to government information management in the near future, while quarantining and preserving the existing mess for longer term clean up.  Leaving the clean up to agencies will not work and, despite the unsettling cost implications, Archives should do it.
