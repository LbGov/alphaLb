												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												People need to know that repositories exist:
• Births, Deaths, Marriages
• Alexander Turnbull Library
• Hocken Library
• Auckland War Memorial Museum
• Archives New Zealand
• Land Information NZ
• Immigration
• Local museums and archives
• Local Body holdings

People need to know why we have records and repositories.
People need to trust the repositories and holdings.
People need to trust the information, accuracy, veracity, usage.
People need to know that information is secure, ie hacker-proof, that facts cannot be easily or randomly changed or erased.
Independence from governmental influence or pressure is essential.
People must feel the process can be trusted, ie
• no misuse of information
• security of storage
• reliability of storage format (especially given that technology changes so rapidly).

Staff knowledge of holdings is important. It needs to be organised and thorough.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The quality of data input is vital, eg
• no typos
• accuracy data fields
• “judgement calls” on what information is gathered and held need to be monitored to prevent
“censorship”.

Original documents are essential as physical documents allow inferences and interpretations to be made, eg the writing style, the writing implements used, the quality of the paper.

In particular, we question the assumption that the economic climate will necessarily be more challenging by 2057 and that this will put pressure on record-keeping decisions. Can we assume that this will be the case, and that keeping and maintaining access to archives will become significantly more expensive? Indeed it may well be that improved technology makes this much cheaper. Similarly, is it possible to predict that there will be a 'smaller productive workforce' in 2057 when we cannot know how the economy might develop in the future, and the new types of jobs that might exist? And can we assume that the 'older population' will not be working? This seems to underlie the idea that less money will be available for Archives management, but we feel this might be overly alarmist.

The wider principle here is we need to be very careful when we try to determine present policy based on what we think might happen in the future. History shows we are generally poor predictors of the future. What is important is that we base archival policies on sound principles, these being ensuring records are maintained to the fullest extent possible, not least of all because we do not know what will interest future researchers, so we are best to preserve whatever we can in an enduring format.

											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												We argue that this should be done by tailoring packages of records for individual communities and making them available in those communities; by demonstrating practical examples of projects to which government archives contribute; and by Archives New Zealand itself being celebratory and inspiring by being more than just regulatory in its attitude to its many publics.

He Tohu exhibition is an excellent example of a way to engage many diverse communities who are interested in the kinds of documents that constitute sovereignty and political citizenship in this country.
Other projects could equally be taken up with other repositories: connecting archives to Treaty settlements processes (which may lead to conversations on how iwi can participate or access more easily taonga and pertinent government information); to colonial Pacific relations; and to Asian immigrant communities.  
Examples such as Te Ara and Papers Past show that New Zealanders are very interested in exploring the past and might provide templates of how to successfully engage the public.

											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												It seems to us that there are many routes to accessibility in a digital world, although an easy-to-use and reliable search function is always a plus for users. We do not necessarily see it as vital that this is done by archivists. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												We trust that Archives New Zealand has been addressing this question for some time now, including looking at what others are doing in the heritage sector, such as Te Papa and the Alexander Turnbull Library.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												One of the cons would be the likelihood of limited uniformity and cohesion across agencies, which may lead to confusion for users. Would agencies set their classifications themselves, requiring them to have the requisite skills to do that in-house, or would they still call on the expertise of Archives New Zealand to assist? Our expectation would be that Archives New Zealand would have a role in holding government to account to ensure ongoing openness of government, that the official information request system would be maintained, and that Archives New Zealand would play an important role in determining what should be kept according to agreed requirements.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?
											</h4>
											<div>
												On the issue of physical versus digital repositories, we note that Archives New Zealand expects that by 2057 high-value holdings will be digitised and very few physical records will be transferred to the organisation, and that rather than having a single government digital archive, records of long-term archival value may ultimately reside in multiple places. In response we would like to emphasise the importance of providing experienced staff who understand the collections, their context, and how to access pertinent information, regardless of how or where records are maintained. Ongoing resources are required to ensure staff are trained and have the means to preserve, manage, and facilitate access to physical holdings and digital holdings.

We also believe that, while it may be appropriate to maintain multiple electronic copies of the same material in different archives, it is absolutely essential that there is one central repository for paper/hard copy archives and electronic archives so as to avoid fragmentation, and that onsite access is maintained. In addition, we question the assumption that with digital services being the primary method for accessing records in 2057, demand for physical access services will likely scale down over time. Indeed, it may be the case that having access to original records becomes more important to people as life is increasingly digitised.

We also note that digital collections open up the possibility that digital formats may become corrupted and less secure, and that strategies will be needed for managing these risks.

Finally, on the issue of open government, while we agree with the principle of access from the point of creation is a good one, that doesn’t mean access to all information should free and open at all times.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?

												Standards based on outcomes and principles. Data based decision-making requires the data be accessible  long-term - and standardised as much as  possible for the long term benefit of NZ. But also we need stories as well as data - powerful - the two must work together - still not balanced in terms of where value is placed.

												Yes – they should be the experts in this, so having a degree of in-house capability to help other organisations makes sense from a whole of government perspective.

												Standards that are outcomes-focussed, principled and less prescriptive would help agencies and reduce Archives New Zealand’s need (and cost) to regularly adapt its standards. Mandatory principles and  outcomes with guidance may best meet system need,s and the guidance could link elements across the environment. If not mandatory the standard may not receive the degree of attention that is desirable and inadvertently reduce the focus on standardisation across the state sector  to realise gains

											<div>
												There is quite a sense of disconnect between the context statements which contain valid ideas and trends (such as big data, the individual's right to forget or at least control information held about them vs the Government's need to account for their interaction with citizens, globalisation the need for traceability.. ), and the questions you pose. The questions seem more tactical than strategic.  There are also underlining assumptions and unresolved tensions in the statements and questions which would be interesting in themselves to explore e.g in section one the introduction frames Archives NZ's role in terms of  'archival value' records, cultural heritage and identity but the questions are about enabling access to  'government information,  these are arguably quite different roles and strategies.  

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												By understanding and adapting to how people look for and discover information, for example their reliance on social networks to be  inspired by and make unexpected connections.  In this respect the challenge may not be the diversity of the communities in a traditional sense, but the diversity in the way individuals discover and use information.
Government records also complete in a very large and undifferentiated market (think Google search). A potential role for Archives NZ  to consider is promotion of the "brand" rather than promotion of the records themselves. "NZ Government information" should  convey immediate connotations of authenticity and reliably to users, such that they implicitly value it over similar information from other sources. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												This raises a broader question as to how seamless that born-digital environment will be for end users in years to come and where Archives New Zealand's  role fits with others such as the GCIO and with agencies themselves in facilitating access. Will the distinction between records and archives still be meaningful in 2057? 
However the critical role that Archives NZ does play is the maintenance of a contextual framework for NZ  government records. i.e. Archives uniquely documents how the structure and functions of government have evolved over time. This is critical to understanding what records were created & where ,  how they were used and what their meaning is . More sophisticated links to, or embedding of rich contextual and functional information will help users navigate, filter and connect government records and information.

											</h4>
											<div>
												Not sure of the purpose of this question. Access classifications are an assessment of risk and agencies will usually be in the best position to understand that risk. 
Archives NZ has a valuable role in  questioning access classification decisions to ensure consistency and reasonableness but it is important to  remember that agencies and the level of risk they manage can be quite different . 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?

											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I think this question needs to be rephrased in terms of the outcome you are seeking. Gaps in the record of government occur for a range of reasons (technological failure , natural and man-made disaster, neglect and poor internal governance). Are you seeking to avoid such gaps or are you looking to more actively shape the long-term  record of government through tools such as macro-appraisal?    
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												It depends on the interpretation of system design?  Agencies employ a plethora of commercial and bespoke systems, connected in different ways for different business purposes. It would be a large undertaking for Archives NZ to involve itself in the design of systems at this level.   
A regulatory role focused on outcomes rather implementation seems to make more sense. 
That said, the growth of government 'as a service' offerings may be a good area for direct involvement.

											<div>
												The outlined directions make sense. I am reassured to see the organisation setting a long term direction. In the public sector there are so many competing priorities and short term demands on services, with limited resources. A long term direction is essential to keeping Archives NZ on track in the medium term and essential to avoiding resources being diverted to programmes of work that do not work towards the long term aims.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Social media presence has proven steadily successful. This should continue to be developed - perhaps by providing some exclusive staff resource to it, as The National Library and other similar institutions have.  Development of a diverse public programme would raise Archives NZ's profile with potential new users. Use of archives is very dependent on people understanding that archives are relevant to their lives. There is something in nearly every archive to capture the interest of any given person - it's just a question of providing the right opportunities for people to explore holdings. Engaging with educational institutions is key to this 2057 focus area - instilling a familiarisation with archives and information discovery in today's children and young people will empower them to be comfortable users of government records in the future; in their work, play, art and leisure. Public programmes need to be delivered online and in person. Although perhaps the public spaces in the current Archives' buildings are not well-suited to a larger scale public programme at the moment. The physical and spiritual connection to archives will always be powerful, but many people cannot travel easily. National and international digital connectivity will only improve over time and Archives NZ needs to surface the material it holds in an online space. A graphic, inspiring and easy to use website that can harvest and promote digital holdings is key to this. It's also essential that Archives NZ releases its descriptive metadata as genuine open data sources - adopting technology that allows others to harvest and analyse it. It could also be worth exploring the next level of remote reference services (for example live chat or face to face video-conference 'ask-the-archivist' sessions to replicate the reading room experience for remote customers).
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Develop an archives management system and digital repository system that can: present born digital archives with all the metadata required both to make sense of the records and to enable users to develop their own analysis tools; enables researchers to navigate the holdings by understanding the relationships between holdings at all levels of their description. The current system presents information overtly in the descriptive conceptual model, but researchers struggle to make this work for them, so Archives NZ needs to design an interface that makes sense to the average user instead of just to archivists. The volumes of born-digital records transferred will be overwhelming for Archives NZ unless archivists and record keepers work together more closely to ensure that born-digital records are accessible and usable from point of creation, with an understanding of the future use for which they are destined. Metadata is key to this. Researchers will find what they need, and even things they weren't expecting, with more powerful search tools and the ability to customise their searches. The more tools Archives NZ provides to enable researchers to share what they have found, the more that use of the public record will grow.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Traditional finding aids do not accommodate the needs of Maori in searching for information. Some government agencies do generate metadata that could be used by Maori to identify the information they need, but there needs to be a way to preserve and accommodate that when moving information between systems. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												A clear pro is that agencies understand their information best. However, due to the passage of time and machinery of government changes there can still be a disconnect between the person setting the access status classifications and the people with real knowledge of the information. Agencies are familiar with government information security classifications and access control models within the agency, but there is no easy way to map between these and Archives NZ access restriction status. There is a strong risk that an unreasonable proportion of public archives end up being un-necessarily restricted and this impacts on a culture of transparency. There may be a tendency towards risk aversion that would result in the value of information not being realised. The current system is a good balance although, as one submission has already stated, having a critical independent body mediate/moderate/approve the decisions could be a better model.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I'm not sure I've fully understood this question. I have a two-pronged response to what I think the question is driving at. 1. Metadata, metadata, metadata and 2. robust common approach to information governance in order to manage data as an asset. Data is managed and used dynamically, so the traditional concept of fixing the record is difficult to respect. The key is to ensure that future consumers of records of decisions and actions understand what information decision-makers had at their disposal at the time.

											</h4>
											<div>
												No response
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Well managed and controlled metadata is key to enabling information to transition between agencies over time. Having tighter control over the number and nature of business and record keeping systems, as well as common standards for metadata and file formats, will help with this challenge. Due to the pressures on them, agencies naturally focus IM efforts on supporting current business needs and it can be hard for information managers to be heard when they propose to dedicate resources to digital continuity measures.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												It is inevitable that any archive (as well as records managers and chance events like accidental loss) plays a role in shaping the permanent record of government and by extension a certain lens on society and history. It's just a question of what degree of influence is deemed appropriate - this will likely change over time as well.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												In terms of system design, Archives could help agencies by offering some imperative to shift to suitable systems and influencing the design of those systems in more than a consultative manner would add to that.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Perhaps a mixture of both. A risk of in-house only is that Archives needs to be able to resource that capability suitably in order to retain it.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Overarching mandatory ones to address the big issues in the sector and more specialised discretionary ones to start working on smaller challenges.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?
											</h4>

												It is worth giving some thought to what the bigger global concerns are likely to be in 2057 and ensuring that Archives works towards goals that increase its value proposition in such a world. For example, a major concern by then is likely to be allocation of natural resources. How do we protect the archival function in such a world?

												A lot of thought will need to be put into helping the users of public records retain and increase their awareness of Archives NZ's purpose and holdings as more records become accessible digitally, particularly under a decentralised model (branding?).  Additionally retaining trust in the record of government when that information may be included in hypercollections that enable "added value" information will possibly require some form of moderation or digital certification.

												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												We need to determine what communities want, create scenarios so they can tell us what they require, in what form and how it should be obtained.  Govt is looking to enhance the self-service aspect so communities must be encouraged to engage.  I think we need to work with them and offer concepts and ideas that would benefit them.  We want to get away from an "open sesame" mentality where you only get the treasures if you know the secret passwords.  If we agree that information is something our communities are entitled to, then I think we need to provide it in a way the communities relate to.  They shouldn't need to be expert system searchers to find what they want.  Improved access is critical, especially via schools and libraries, but also churches, temples, etc.  Use sources relevant to communities rather than processes that suits govt.  Seek to meet with community leaders, contribute at cultural events, field days and festivals.  Provide multi-lingual options or translations.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Increase tech savvy, voice activated search queries like the "OK Google" function on mobile phones enables me to ask my phone for the local fish and chip shop then ring it to place an order - why not for information.  My phone tells me there's a bill to pay tomorrow, that my family photos can be uploaded - I don't tell it: it tells me!  As an older person I find that a bit creepy, but may perfectly suit those born in other generations.  Can we harness that system knowledge to navigate information?  Can we utilize social media to lodge requests, get feedback from other users, e.g. the way Neighbourly.co.nz works?I think we certainly need to expand the digitisation programme.  Storage costs are surely likely to fall... I hope. We need to cultivate relationships with public media such as newspapers and TV by supplying useful supplementary information relevant to current stories so that people become more aware of what's available and expect to see it inform current affairs.  Little waxed boxes with strange codes should be for the backroom genius, not something people should need to navigate.  Maybe we need to change the concept of archives (old stuff that Gramps goes in to look at) and archivists (old people in tweed that remember Gramps when he was a boy) and build a more dynamic image of savvy information managers.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Current processes suit the academic mindset or those versed in the navigation of official structures.  Access through verbal requests, which parallel oral tradition, rather than form filling may be more useful.  Fluent speakers of Te Reo who can facilitate access would be appreciated as would people who revere taonga.  Access through marae, trusts, kohanga reo, whare karakia, etc may make information more accessible.  Contextualize information so that it has relevance for Maori, foster relationships between Maori and govt information sources particularly those areas traditionally resistant to information release.  I think real relationship between repositories and Maori is critical, I think the current processes are too transactional and I sometimes think our emphasis on customer service is about "what do you want? Here it is" can be an obstacle.  A relationship means listening - not just to the point where I think I know what someone means and then dashing off and fixing it or getting it or solving it.  Perhaps we're sometimes too solution-driven??
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Inconsistent classifications over similar information between different or separate departments may arise, organisations may classify according to present needs whereas research is looking for other information.  Agencies may have traditional views on withholding information or have a business culture of restricting information.  Depending on the agency's funding for information staff the skills may vary greatly.  Centralised classifications may be a better option with special arguments for why information should or should not be available sooner rather than agencies setting the access and exceptions being made to their rules.  I also think we need to manage fears around blame and accusation as some classifications may be intended to avoid risk or loss of reputation
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I think centralising the process helps as well as centralising the information structures.  Some independent system or body is perhaps required to act as a watchdog without resorting to a wikileaks situation. Building awareness and improving access in the community may be the best solution as material may be more accessible when more people know about it.  I also think ICT needs to be involved making it easier and smarter for people to find what they want and need.  Ensuring information remains available requires a multi-pronged approach involving all our communities.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Robust legislation I think would go a long way.  The OIA, LGOIMA and PRA could weave stronger access and stake out the information territory.  Other Acts, when updated, could include an increased information access focus rather than the information Acts bowing to other legislation, the expectation in legislation is that information management is strengthened.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Perhaps they should have "wills" where their information is bequeathed to a new organisation. Any organisation established by Parliament should have information management explicitly stated in their Act.  A standard handover process should be implemented that is structured and budgeted for as part of any merge or closure.  I think such a process should be developed centrally and implemented as soon as an organisation is born/merged.  It certainly should not be left to the last minute scramble.  I think such a process will need to be delivered through smart technology.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Absolutely.  And ANZ should be aware early in the organisation's life what those records are.  For that to happen the information needs to available for assessment, shareable, easily located.  All this, in my opinion, is impossible without centralised technology to manage it.  I think many organisations would be grateful to have the expertise supplied remotely by ANZ rather than having to recreate the wheel and work it out for themselves.  Incidentally, or not, perhaps Archives NZ should become Information New Zealand.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I think ANZ should embed recordkeeping regulation in system design.  Organisations waste bucketloads of money trying to get this right.  We want the best brains in the country working on this so everyone can get on with what they're supposed to be doing instead of wrestling with the inevitable, loathed recordkeeping system or dreaming up ever new ways of keeping their records out of it.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I think ANZ should work with ICT.  I think it should be controlled through ANZ, but I don't know that it should be fully inhouse.  My own organisation has developed profiles of our customers and are now asking vendors what they can offer us.  I think ANZ should cherry-pick from the commercial world and use virtual teams. Some in-house capability will be more useful in some areas and other work may need to be outsourced. I think ANZ needs to be agile in this - I have horrid visions of some sort of Ministry monolith with people leaning on their shovels... I definitely think ANZ needs to call the shots and not be dictated to by contractors because ANZ is in for the long haul and contractors and products and brilliant new ideas come and go.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?

											<div>
												We've had voluntary for over 10 years and while our awareness is higher I don't think we've progressed terribly far so now I think we need to make it mandatory - and with penalties that compare e.g. with the Tax Administration Act.

											<div>
												I think Archives NZ probably could reference what is going on internationally with digital archiving, and what has been done already. Probably also need to find out more from technology leaders to find out where things are headed in terms of content and EDRMS systems, even though it changes quickly there should be some other digital-future strategies to reference.

											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Need way more engagement in local communities, museums, galleries, schools, universities etc. What you have is a strong resource, but often people don't know it is there. I didn't know about Archives NZ until after I left University! How did I not find out about that vital NZ resource at School or Uni? If I had heard about it, was it easily accessible to me? I think this is the opportunity to create an awesome digital resource for education, and other communities that is well known and branded. Social Media is the ideal pathway now.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												This is a big question, but in terms of accessibility, the system needs to be clean and simple. Archway isn't very user friendly. The public won't understand Agency Codes and numbers. Search needs to be strong. Dates need to be filterable. Digital records should be easier to work with in some ways. Simplicity is key though. Simple, clean, design, but with the ability to drill down to find what you need. You need some good categorisation and taxonomies planned and created well from the start- this will be key, and a user friendly searchable system. Test it with a well defined good set of records to begin with, get feedback, test it with many users, change it if it doesn't work. Archivists should be tech savvy, and knowledgeable about what records exist so they can support users further.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Knowledge about what exists, and how to find it. Perhaps the same as any other cultural group.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Pros - knowledge about the content and how it should be restricted/accessed. Cons - lack of consistency across agencies where interpretation might be different.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Not sure exactly what you mean by 'government interventions are based on data'. Important information can only remain accessible if the record-keepers know what is important info and how to manage it accordingly. Need good, clear standards, and would require more input from Archives staff to provide good quality training and advice recordkeepers. There is a lack of presence from Archives NZ in person, actually meeting records staff in organisations (that aren't in Wellington) and knowing the unique environments/challenges they work with.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Shouldn't really matter if Govt decision making methods change as long the record keeping standards are strong.  
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Clear standards on what happens when agencies merge/cease to exist. Clarity in the legislation. 
											</div>

											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												No. Every organisation is going to be different. YOu could spend 10 years designing the perfect system and it will change continually. Organisations themselves are the experts, they are dealing with these system changes daily. Archives need to provide clear regulation and support for those seeking advice on best practise for their own unique systems. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Not necessarily. Expertise and knowledge would be useful, but again they should be there to support and advice, and work with, organisations who are trying to achieve good system design. Archives could work with various IT companies around NZ PRA so they are able to support orgs successfully. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?

											<div>
												By developing a much stronger outreach programme and presence. It is essential that effective and continuous dialogue with identified and prospective user communities be initiated, if necessary with messages tailored. Recognition that the stakeholders extend well beyond government agencies.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												A range of straightforward tools, both in digital and hard copy formats, including more extended administrative histories, would be helpful. There is also a need to develop easily understood 'how to search' guides for targeted communities, including ethnic. It is axiomatic that there should be appropriate qualifications for those involved in this work.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Lack of proper communication on the part of institutions as to the content of records and how it might be accessed.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I see no pros in permitting agencies to set their own access classifications. From sad experience over many years agencies have a tendency to view records as 'theirs alone', and consequently are more inclined to obfuscate and hide rather than promote open access. While agencies may have legitimate concerns re access to certain classes of records, restrictions beyond those set out in legislation should only be set in consultation with, and the approval of, the Chief Archivist.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The focus of this question is a little unclear. Whatever the format of records, and however they are used in decision-making, Archives New Zealand must remain the legal guardian of the public record, and therefore logically has responsibility for ensuring data remains accessible. Notwithstanding its present administrative placement, the role of Archives New Zealand is analogous to that of the Office of the Auditor General.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Whatever the methods of government decision-making, records must be created and therefore fall under the provisions of the archives legislation. Archives New Zealand's role is is to ensure full and consistent compliance with that legislation. It should be out there as a presence, proactive rather than reactive.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												There is nothing new about this - it has been an ongoing responsibility for Archives New Zealand (as in the 'reforms' of 1980s). It is imperative that decision-makers, including SSC and politicians,  be made fully aware of their obligations under the legislation. It is recognised that this is not always easy or comfortable, but the powers in the legislation were drafted to be used.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Surely Archives New Zealand is already doing this? It is one of the obligations under the existing legislation, notwithstanding an impression that on occasion agencies are allowed more leeway in making decisions about what should be kept than might be considered prudent. I have major concerns that policy files appear to presently be considered of far greater importance than case files, the latter being essential evidence of the efficacy of policy decisions.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												These functions should not logically be separated. Regulation is essential if the integrity of public record-keeping is to be ensured. No less, however, Archives New Zealand should have a distinct role monitoring and advising agencies on system design, being out there liaising with records creators.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												It is essential to develop in-house capability to ensure professional credibility with other agencies, but expertise may also be sought elsewhere. Arguably, what will be vital in forthcoming decades is encouraging/requiring agencies to realistically move towards a whole of government record-keeping system. While it is noted the current CEO of DIA is designated the government's Chief Information Officer, it might be argued that the Chief Archivist has a claim to some part of this role.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I have no confidence in  voluntary standards, which are too often more observed in the breach than reality. While mandatory requirements should be the foundation of public record-keeping, they may nevertheless be devised by Archives New Zealand in consultation with creators and agencies' records staff. But the power of prescription should  be reposed in Archives New Zealand.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?
											</h4>
											<div>
												That Archives New Zealand is expected to have a leadership role in the wider archival sector is acknowledged in the opening notes. That this role is genuinely accepted must be made clear, especially in respect of community archives, iwi archives, etc. Ideally, there should be dedicated staff for this role. It is as important as a leadership role in the Pacific.
