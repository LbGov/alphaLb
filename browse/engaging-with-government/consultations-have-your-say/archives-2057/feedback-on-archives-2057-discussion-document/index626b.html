											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Tell stories that relate to the communities and that people can have a personal connection to (and contribute to). For example use social media channels and develop a strong public programme (both online and in the 'real world'). Ensure that information/ archives can be found easily, used and re-used. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												1. Ensure that archives are clearly described, the context and provenance are accurate and meaningful (using appropriate archival descriptive practice - to maintain the 'formal' record - what ever it is or may become in the future). 2.  Create an environment and archival management system (or other solution) that will allow communities and individuals to enhance and contribute to the description of archives (to optimise discoverability and re use) - e.g. crowd sourcing...etc. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Access channels, archival systems (currently ARCHWAY) and descriptive information included in the system do not adequately reflect or support a Maori view of knowledge or knowledge sharing. For example it is not clear where taonga/ information related to different groups (such as iwi or hapu...etc) exist within the Archival holdings. Where it is known it is not easy to add this information to the system - for staff or for 'users' (e.g. crowd sourcing to enhance descriptive information and tagging). There is also a limited resource of staff at Archives New Zealand with appropriate knowledge, experience and expertise to enhance records retrospectively. 

Because transferring public offices do not (and probably should not?) have a requirement to add descriptive information of high value to Maori as a part of the current transfer process, the responsibility to enhance these records (to unlock their full value for everyone) belongs to Archives New Zealand (post transfer). 

 Also, the current physical environment, services and approach used to engage in archival research do not meet the needs of Maori for various reasons.  Archives New Zealand needs to make changes to foster a greater awareness of Te Ao Maori into modern archival practice and radically assess the way access is delivered (on site and online) so that they can actively engage with the wider Maori community in meaningful and sustainable ways.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												This is a tricky one .... it depends what the role of the public office is, what the records are and if they  choose to identify the records as open or closed access. I think it is probably more beneficial to stick with the current regime where 1. public office identifies what they think the access status should be and 2. access status is reviewed by a group of people (in consultation with the public office). Then the final decision is made (currently by the Chief Archivist).  

It is probably best for an external body to approve access status as this would hopefully support transparency and better trust in government information in the long term....
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Not sure about this one - the key is to ensure that information is discoverable, understandable, and accessible long term. Identifying clearly what is important information and which public offices (or functions of government) are generating important information. Then these 'functions' or the public office/s involved in generating that information could be more closely supported or regulated (in particular with regard to how data is being generated, shared and re-used).  A solution to identifying who is accountable or responsible for maintaining this information is an issue that would need to addressed, (particularly in the context of collaborative work for example).
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												See comment above
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												See comment above
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes. It is quite controversial to suggest this approach, and is goes against traditional archival practice/ theory. However, there would be a benefit in developing an acquisition policy (much like a collections policy - which I know is a naughty thing to say). I would see an acquisition policy sitting along side a more traditional appraisal process, where the public office identifies the 'business' value and retention periods for their records as a part of standard appraisal - which would most likely in the future (say 10 - 20 years time for example) be an activity incorporated in to system design to allow for automated sentencing/ disposal/ transfer. The second phase of 'appraisal' using Archives New Zealand's acquisition policy could take place at this time. The acquisition policy would view the records through an 'archival lens' and presumably would be focussed on records that are of high 'cultural' or societal value, records that may in future may protect the rights and entitlements of the people...for example. I could see this working better than the current system of 'collecting' that we have in place.

											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I think it should do both but focus on high risk/ value functions of government. E.g. - It depends on the function the public office and the type of information they are generating. 1. Identify which functions or public offices are generating 'high value/ high risk' information. 2. Regulate the development and implementation of the systems (at the point of the systems being designed) 3. Monitor how the systems are being used and the quality of the information being generated/ managed using the system.  People create, use and manage information...it's a symbiotic relationship between systems/ tools and people, this is why you need to regulate both recordkeeping/ information management and system design.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Both. In house - digital preservation in particular - this team should be able to advise and collaborate with Public Offices. System design - regulate and support/ advise.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Again it depends on what the function of the Public Office is and what type of information they are generating. I'd probably lean more towards having mandatory standards (that are realistically implementable) and have less of them. Then identify the Public Offices that are generating very high value/ high risk records and more actively regulate or support? these sectors.

											<div>
												Pros: Every agency knows its records better than anybody else.
Cons: 1) The agency may not be familiar with the access restrictions. 2) The access restrictions may be contradictory and their limits blurry depending on the approach (OIA vs Privacy). It can be tricky even for experts. 3) Proper assessment of records vs resources management.

												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?

											<div>
												There will always be archival silences because organizations change as people do, and the policies are also changed over the time. However, it would be good that ANZ was less reluctant to take legacy records that have long term restricted access.

											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I think they are complimentary: RK regulation tell you what to do with your records and system design is the tool that you use to manage your records (but you need to know what to do with your records before hand)

											<div>
												Mandatory requirement are necessary but they also need to be a few simple and easy to reach/achieve ones. Voluntary standards must be put in place as a way to impulse good practice and as a temporary induction of a requirement that will be mandatory later on.

												The overall directions very positive. I do Reckon you need to do more to promote what you do and what you have  My family - aunts, grandparents - have used you a lot in the past few years but only because I told them about you.   I think you are a bit of an unknown secret   Clear intention about moving to records transfers in digital format good.  Pleased to see national archives on this track as I'm worried about how government depts are managing digital records.  Strong leadership from you on this would be good 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												You need to improve your web site, also Archway not that easy to use unless experienced or a professional.   More digital content really needed, and paying online My family have come in to you but for me to use directly, I want digital content because I'm still working   I'm a big ancestry user and that's how to connect these days
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												you could help with well organised information like Archivist's sign posting?  Setting it out clearly on line and making it easy for people to use.   An archive overseas I use a lot has thousand of non indexed documents online which sounds great but it's a pain really.   I have to go thro stuff page by page... So I reckon the archive and Archivist should do a lot of indexing to help find stuff

You are the ones who really hold new Zealands history but no one seems to know.  Reckon you should promote yourself more.  And you need to be a strong leader to ensure our history ends up with national archives.  This document asks the right sort of questions but step it up more please
