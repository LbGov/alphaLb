												There is very little, certainly not enough, recognition in the 2057 document of the importance of community archives in ANZ, the story they carry of our social history. What support will be offered to small community archives in the year 2057?

											<div>
												Engagement with diverse communities of users is a key challenge for all archival authorities. While better funded institutions may allocate resources to public programming and public engagement programs, not all institutions have that capacity. Other approaches could include partnering with community groups and other cultural institutions, working with volunteer networks, or enabling community feedback and participation to add value to the core catalogue of holdings.

												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												There is a clear public expectation, which translates into a political expectation, that in the 21st century government information should be digital.  Government information is being created as digital content, however archival authorities still hold large collections of physical archives. Any strategy going forward has to address public and political expectations that government archives must be digital and that existing physical archives must be delivered digitally. This is a difficult narrative with expectations of digital access at odds with the rate of digitization (eg NAA having digitized only 4% of holdings over a decade) and the rate of transfer of born-digital archives (Archives New Zealand, PROV and SRANSW with only small holdings of born-digital archives transferred). There is a gap between expectation and reality which must be addressed through a principled and careful narrative with a clear outcome in mind. 

Archival authorities should also clearly articulate archival principles which address the context, evidential value and integrity of the record in order to help people navigate government archives. Archivists must present a coherent narrative to explain the purpose of an archival authority in plain language in order to address demands for use. Systems for controlling and providing access to information, records and archives in a born-digital environment should be as intuitive and accessible as archival principles will allow.

											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												This question could be re-cast to ask “In what context and with what framework should government agencies make access decisions?” What is the role (is there a role) for Archives New Zealand in achieving consistency across government agencies with regard to access status of types of government records? In Western Australia government agencies have a legislative framework within which to assess the information they create and to classify the access status of that information. The SROWA assists the agency in developing their Retention and Disposal Schedule and the agency requests approval from the State Records Commission (Auditor General, Information Commissioner, Ombudsman and an information professional) with feedback from an advisory committee and with the recommended access status set using precedents established through specific legislation or based on similar records types in other government agencies or in other jurisdictions. The aim of the framework is to allow the agency to request the access status classification within a framework which provides a consistent, standardised approach. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												In a West Australian context, the SROWA requires agencies to meet minimum compliance requirements to safeguard the integrity of their digital records. Agencies are required to keep data and migrate it for as long as the data is needed (both in terms of business requirements and for long-term retention of critical data/archival data).  The risk and the responsibility for the data in agency custody is with the agency. How an agency manages their data and the technical solutions they employ are in some ways up to the agency – however the agencies are required to  manage their data to achieve minimum outcomes, including accessibility, migration and ongoing management of data.

											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												(see above)
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes. Absolutely.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The assumption throughout the discussion document that “digital systems capability” can help address the strategic focus areas is sound. Similarly the statement “This will require checks and balances to be in place around privacy and security” is also fine. However systems and system designs change over time – especially given the discussion document is contemplating a forty year time-frame. Archival principles should endure and these should be applied by archival authorities in establishing functional requirements for recordkeeping systems. SROWA favours taking an active role in understanding recordkeeping/business systems however does not advocate designing one system or imposing a singles system design.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Both. The question is something of a false dichotomy. Perhaps a clear strategic statement should be that Archives New Zealand intends to address system design and that the organisation should develop the skill-set/capacity to address system design. The outcome over forty years will most likely be achieved through many combinations of in-house and external solutions. How this is achieved is not as important as what it is Archives New Zealand wants to achieve and that the organisation understands/has the appropriate expertise.   
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Perhaps the question to consider first could be “What does Archives New Zealand/the New Zealand government want to achieve with standards?” Then consider can this be achieved through voluntary or mandatory requirements. Have other archival authorities in other jurisdictions set similar expectations, did they use voluntary or mandatory and have they achieved their outcomes? In a Western Australian context, mandatory standards are statements of principles with clear minimum compliance requirements. There is flexibility in how these minimum requirements are met, and SROWA provides advice, training and technical guidelines for agencies.

											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												As above, advertising & a downloaded Archives app., to smart phones / tablets:- Your Archives – leading to the present ANZ webpage – What we have, Our Services, Research & Ordering etc,

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Lack of awareness by Maori of the taona held by ANZ & how the information can be accessed. Promote via all schools & the local Marae, advertise, have an ANZ awareness week, where this is promoted as part of their heritage when significant anniversaries occur – Waitanki, Parihaka etc. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												They should be set up within ANZ guidelines, to ensure uniformity between all agencies, other wise there will be fragmented access status classifications
Agencies classify their records according to their type of records, but one access status & classification may not fit all types of records. 
Agencies need to set up their own parameters & discuss with ANZ

											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?

											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The merging of government agencies is a logical consequence of the streamlining of various services to provide greater efficiency. ANZ is now part of the DIA, if agencies are combined, their records/data must remain accessible regardless of what platform it’s stored on, assume all agencies will be using the same platform, so records can be accessed / transferred between them. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes - records should be kept long term to preserve the collective memory of the nation. Despite there being physical storage issues in Wellington, with the move to digital, the amount of physical paper records will decrease over time. 
Records - Physical / electronic are held in Provincial Museums, Art Galleries, Libraries, Schools, Sports clubs etc.  Under the current ANZ GDA, some types of records remain with them, while others are transferred to ANZ. The problem with records, held in these locations is their preservation in climate controlled, fire proofed areas.  Some provincial museums are recognised by ANZ as repositories for records, while others not, due to building structural deficiencies & to limitations of their storage facilities. If these locations are not upgradable due to costs, to preserve their records long term, they will need to be transferred to ANZ  

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												- Maintaining regulations in line with current legislation at the time to meet present & future requirements, but ensuring compliance is met by agencies is the key problem
- How is this going to be enforced? 
- System design – ongoing maintenance & upgrade to meet projected growth – e.g every five / seven years leading up to 2057?
- Where will the data be stored?
- In the Cloud?
- Multiple servers in major cities – Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch & Dunedin?
- Data can be “kept” at any location, as long as it accessible, if one site becomes unavailable, data must still be accessible from other locations

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												- Both – Government In-House designs have had costly failures in the past - bad design/cost blowouts. 
- Private companies cannot always guarantee end dates without cost blowouts
- A partnership between Govt. Agency/private company with strict oversight & accountability
- System / project audits carried out by independent third party

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												- As this document notes, there are “disappointing” levels of recordkeeping maturity among public offices 10 years after Public Records Act came into effect
- A combination of voluntary standards & requirements, supported by regular audits.
- Self auditing on a yearly basis, followed with site visits.

											<div>
												• Public Records Act 2005 needs to be reviewed and updated – public sector and LA treated the same in regard to audits.
• There does appear to be a lack of focus on Local Authorities throughout the document.
• Archives NZ need to show strong leadership on ensuring information is managed according to best practice. 
• Archives NZ need to make sure disposal of both paper and electronic is happening.
• Archives NZ need to regulate that all agencies will operate digitally from a certain date – say 5 years from now or earlier. The sooner the better.  Australia have done it – do we know how successful it has been?
• Page 9 of the document - Early digital preservation assessment is required so that information is available for as long as needs be – how is this going to happen?  
• Photos in the document focusing on archives, not records.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												• Targeted marketing to specific customers.
• Need to look at who are your customers and what are their needs.
• Communication and marketing to change perception of what Archives NZ do.
• Marketing the value of information and how it should be treated as an asset. 
• Maybe rebranding and a name change to reflect the focus shift – it is not all about archives. It is about the management of all information – structured and unstructured in all formats.
• Relevance – ensure it is relevant and useful. Customers must perceive that it has value and importance.
• Information must be easy to access.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												• Access online, but it must be easy to navigate and search – it must “follow your nose”.
• On line training videos.
• Archives NZ need to ensure it has the appropriate resources available to manage the born digital information.
• Leadership and visibility in local authorities.
• More proactive rather than reactive.
• More of a prescriptive role. Need to direct local authorities.
• Need to promote the benefits of good information management – it is not all about compliance. 

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												• Lack of specialist knowledge and facilities.
• Need to look at how the low socio-economic groups can access this information.
• Need to investigate what are their needs, what information is of interest to them.
• Need to set up partnerships with Archives NZ as they might not be able to do it on their own.
• Internet access is not necessarily available in certain areas such as the far north.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												• Cons - Everyone will interpret the guidelines/rules differently and therefore there will not be consistency. It will vary between agencies which will mean it would be difficult to share information in the future. Customers will not have access to all the information.
• Needs to be very clear guidelines to ensure consistency.
• Access status classifications should be set by Archives NZ. It would save agencies time and money. We wouldn’t have to reinvent the wheel. For local authorities, we are all in the same business and adhering to the same legislation, so we should all be using the same access restrictions.
• This could drive system use.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												• Archives NZ needs to be able to have the resources to ensure standards, guidelines, advice and training are available. They are the agency to regulate the management of information so need to be proactive in all information management areas.
• Being prescriptive about data standards.
• Setting mandatory data standards.
• Open data needs to be standardised to ensure accessibility and usability. Data is collected once but can have many uses.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Assess > Design > Implement > Evaluate.
Continuous review and improvement.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												 If we all comply with the standards/guidance set by Archives NZ then that would make mergers or transfer of information to another agency much easier.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes! So everyone is singing from the same song sheet and working in the same way.
Definitely – for consistency.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												No, Archives NZ should be doing both.
The IM profession requires standards and guidance on both.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												• In-house – how can they provide guidance if they do not have specialist knowledge?
• IT Professionals/Project Managers tend to do their own thing without looking at IM requirements – if Archives NZ had in-house experts then they would be able to influence/ communicate directly with the IT Professionals/Project Managers.
• With in-house capability Archives NZ should be able to influence vendors on IM requirements to ensure information remains accessible and useable over time.
• System design should incorporate as many automated processes as possible to ensure consistency in the creation, capture and management of the information and make it easier for users. This should be happening sooner rather than later.
• How can we ask Archives NZ for help and advice if they have no capability? Who would advise us - vendors? 

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												• Very prescriptive - so that all agencies create and maintain full and accurate records of their business activities in the same way. 
• Mandatory standards – who else is going to ensure consistency? 
• Mandatory means the sharing of information between agencies will be much easier and users of the information will have consistency no matter which agency they are receiving the information from.
• Mandatory audits of local government agencies by Archives NZ – this would mean a change to the Public Records Act 2005.
• Archives NZ needs to keep up to date with the emerging trends in information systems and technology.

												Those responsible for the administration of Archives NZ have no option but to be faced with the unenviable task of giving the highest priority to increased funding. It is unenviable because it may entail diverting funding from immediate demands of its functioning as a national archives.
There will be many responses to this questionnaire detailing what, quite properly, should be done. Unfortunately few of the recommendations will be achievable without increased funding.
My own responses should also be seen in this light.

											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Developing strong outreach programmes which have the ability to educate and inspire both producers and potential users in the value and utility of public records -- not just those records which are non-current and are of permanent value. The programmes should be done in consultation with people who have expertise in public relations and
delivered by people who have had PR training as well as the essentials of archival practices.

											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												It needs to be recognised that, with very few exceptions, the prime objectives of government agencies, is to perform the functions that enable them to achieve the objectives of the Acts or Regulations by which they operate. Rarely do these functions include providing access  to records to people outside the agency.
It is therefore unsurprising that matters such as making provision for outsiders' access has low, or even, negative priority.
While it should be recognised that, for a period time, closed access is a necessity, it should also be recognised that, eventually, all records should be publicly available.
The only way to resolve the issue is for it to be made mandatory that access is to be determined by consultation between an informed Chief Archivist and the CEO of that agency. Access would not be the only issue to be determined: there is also the issue of ensuring that records, which are not to be released for many years, should be kept in accommodation suitable for long term preservation. At least nine times out of ten, this means storage under the direct control of Archives NZ.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Archives NZ must take the initiative of ensuring that agencies are constantly reminded of their archival responsibilities. 
This implies an active Archives NZ participation in the agencies record-keeping practices.




											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												As above.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												By formulating, and continually up-dating standard-operating-procedures for such events and reminding all agencies of same.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The answer is obvious. If Archives NZ had had sufficient resources in the past to participate actively in the agencies record-keeping there would be far fewer gaps than there are now.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Should do both.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Without in-house capability to influence system design Archives NZ will not be able to fulfil its responsibilities. Only when it has this capability will it be able to decide to what degree it will work through others.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?

												Sweden has one of the oldest and most effective archives and records systems in the world. Yet for at least a couple of hundred years it operated without archives legislation. The reason it functioned so well, however, was because Sweden has long operated an effective Freedom of Information system.

This needs to be across all the diverse groups and ages of people which make up the community of New Zealand.   Some of the ways this could be achieved is by writing (or co-authoring) articles for newspapers and magazines across every genre and by providing stories using examples which are relevant to the audience.

												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?

												The focus should move from Records management, Archives management to content management. Data plays a big role in todays world and we should include the data standards and the open data policy as much we focus on the documents and records.

											<div>
												Lack of focus on Local Government
Open Data completely lacking – this is already our reality and will only expand into our future. Believe Archives NZ needs to have a position and their staff/advisors should be competent to advise in this space. Is a key consideration for our digital world.
Lack of useable toolsets e.g. Digital Continuity and Preservation needs a much bigger focus if we seriously want to manage our digital information world. Currently we are using National Archives Australia templates and tools as to plan and implement as Archives NZ doesn’t provide anything useful or useable.
Review of the PRA is overdue – certainly from a Local Government perspective. If the plan is to treat all government information (central and local) equally then that needs to be addressed in the Act.

											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Why is there a singular focus on ‘archivists’ helping people navigate digital information? Archivists are not the only people who can interpret and understand information. 
There needs to be provision for multiple options for access – with online being the easiest way to achieve this.

	Arbitrary

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												It would make sense to incorporate system design into the focus rather than shift it from regulation as they are complimentary rather than separate.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Development of capability in house is absolutely essential if the plan is to have recordkeeping services and advice carrying and strength of weight and actually sought rather than ignored. General sense that there is not enough agility.

											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
