												Staff training and ‘buy in’ to conserving pre-digital material with intelligent care despite the often-encountered regard of it as old-fashioned and a mere duplication of the new is essential. Data relationship across history is vital. With the current decline in standards of hand-writing, spelling and grammar it should be a requirement for staff to reach a standard acceptable for archival repository of both digital and hard copy items. Hand-written material should be checked by more than one operator in an effort to rationalise ambiguities which often arise through trying to understand words and context.  
Original documents are essential, as physical documents allow inferences and interpretations to be made, e.g. the writing style, the writing implements used, the quality of the paper.
Digitised materials must be labelled and tagged accurately and able to be related to any non-digital origin easily for quality control of information.

There needs to be easy access though a range of methods, e.g.
 • in person 
• on line
• by telephone

Digital archives must be backed up other than solely in “the cloud”, e.g. hard copies, original document storage.

												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?

												Tell stories of 'finds to the general populace - such as ancestral land, habitations, employment and relevant connections, focusing also on secretaries of organisations, perhaps.

												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>

												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?

											<div>
												Voluntary standards are risky to maintaining archives appropriately.

												This review is definitely worth doing and makes effective allowances for both amateur and professional users.

												The discussion paper suggests a shift to a requirement for all government agencies to a digital format by a specified date referring to the Australian and Dutch examples. Such a chance would have a substantial impact on those public offices which still rely on paper records due to statutory requirements or other business needs. Given the significance of any such change this issue could have been usefully addressed with a specific question. 

Given the high costs and change management implications with transitioning to a primarily digital records management context, an acknowledgment of these consequences will need to be included in any resulting strategy including such a requirement.

												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Part of the problem with non expert users of Archives NZ systems and processes (especially applying to diverse communities where English may be a secondary language) is that while catalogues such as ARCHWAY are useful tools, more information especially to assist with context based search strategies (e.g. via agency – series) would be useful.  In addition, key information to assist users should be in multiple languages. 
Further work in supporting approved repositories via technical advice and resourcing will be an effective means of ensuring the wider distribution of paper records with a specific regional or cultural focus.

											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												See above comments. The issue of Maori engagement has been a thorny one for archivists dating back to at least the 1980’s partly over difficult issues relating to custody and ownership of taonga (which may include archives). 
At one level the problems of access to archives for Maori are the same as any other group (e.g. getting to grips with search techniques) but at another, Archives NZ like many other government agencies have struggled to interpret the implications of Maori needs from government and how they translate into meaningful and lasting action.

											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The advantage of government agencies managing access is that the accountability for access decision making remains with the records creator which, in my view is generally appropriate. The problem is that this is time consuming and often impractical for agencies especially if file by file inspections of records are required to determine which should be open or closed access.  Consequently, many agencies impose lengthy blanket access restrictions for long periods unnecessarily and at the cost of easy access to records.

At the same time when I worked at Archives NZ during the period of the Archives Act 1957 and access were negotiated between the Chief Archivist and agencies transferring records, problems were sometimes caused where there was disagreement about access restrictions with the occasional consequence, that some agencies refused to transfer records to Archives New Zealand. 

In a New Zealand context, I do not believe that the option of Archives NZ imposing access restrictions unilaterally on public records would be appropriate or practical apart from cases where an agency has become defunct without a successor.

											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Absolutely. The lack of a methodology to identify, at a cross governmental level, the types of records (e.g. at a agency or functional level) which should be preserved has left substantial gaps in the public archive. In its absence, the appraisal approach has generally been dependent for government agencies to identify records of archival value via appraisal and then initiate transfer. The activities of those parts of government which have not prioritised appraisal or transfer may be permanently excluded from the public archive. This lack of active intervention is especially problematic for born digital records where active intervention is required from creation, management through to disposal. 

There are methodologies for identifying the most significant record locations in government by criteria defining which records are the most significant to government and people (variations of functional or macro-appraisal). Such a methodology could include a definition of so-called silences and intervene to ensure the creation, maintenance and permanent preservation of such records. In its absence which records are preserved will contain dependent on how individual agencies interpret the business significance of their records.

												5	Other thoughts
Significant Professional Trends for Archives New Zealand Consideration
•	Review the Public Records Act 2005 for relevance and issues feedback from agencies.
•	Review the List of Protected Records for Local Authorities. There are records not included from the previous review.
•	Create new general disposal authorities, current ones are not meeting national needs.

Incorporated Digital and Data Management into the Regulatory Framework and Guidance
•	Archives New Zealand should establish advice, guidance on data and digital practices into regulation and standards. Provide more guidance on sustainable solutions.
•	Bring back more national training and forums run by Archives New Zealand. Don’t outsource it. The forums promote dialogue, exchange of ideas and inform the professional community.
•	Archives New Zealand to provide new models of transfer management, both physical and digital platforms. There needs to be more investigation into Archives New Zealand proposal for linking and integrating access collections. Is it even feasible without master data management considerations?
•	Data is a record type, there is a lack of any set mandatory standards on how data types should be managed.
•	Archives New Zealand should incorporate data and digital format management within its work programme.
Resilience and Future Proofing
•	Archives New Zealand to develop more in Project Management and partner up with experts to support development and developing trends.
•	Archives New Zealand to establish and implement new governance models for archival services.
•	Review the legislation – Public Records Act 2005 – as there are significant gaps in the audit programme that need to be in place if Archives New Zealand wants to support this vision.
•	Archives New Zealand to incorporate digital data into their framework.
•	Information, records and data management projects across New Zealand require Archives New Zealand input.

												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												•	Implement effective modern marketing and sales techniques.
•	Thinking should expand beyond New Zealand geographical borders.
•	Promote services through networking and professional events.
•	Exhibit collections across New Zealand and globally.
•	Actively leverage technology and promote capabilities through custom apps etc.
•	Maintain obsolete technologies to ensure records in those format, from those eras, are able to be retrieved. Become a repository of no longer available technology (devices, equipment). 
•	Interact with the public through opening up locations and making them “exciting”.
•	Interact using human channels not just technology i.e. put a human face to Archives New Zealand.
•	Understand how society “plays and their leisure movements”, use the power of advertising channels to promote yourselves. Utilise exhibitions to attract and bring in viewers and users.

												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												•	Archives New Zealand will have to undertake intensive consultation directly with the Maori.
•	Understanding how to utilise what is significant to the Maori like meeting places, Huis, sharing of Kai.
•	Archives New Zealand needs to understand Maori engage different to business. The challenge will be business timeframes, expectations, business activities and use of technology (internet, email use, cell phone), and how if any of these are used to conduct Maori affairs.
•	Similar barriers to government information would exist for anyone of any ethnicity but allowances must be made for cultural differences.
•	Local communities are not aware of Archives New Zealand or their services.
•	The culture and conduct at the marae is different from that of government. Challenge for Archives New Zealand to make it an inviting place, and accessible place.

											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												PROS
•	Can be amended to suit.
•	Decisions are made by few.

CONS
•	Not standardised making future hyper-collection integration “interesting”.
•	All agency staff may not be fully aware of privacy requirements especially if they are subject to interpretation.
•	Governments and as such their focus areas are susceptible to change over time. They are also reactive to public and political expectations.
•	Current practices are heavily reliant on the skills, knowledge and experience of a human workforce with non-standardised skills, knowledge and experiences.
•	Not subject to audit.
•	Corrective actions on inaccurate access restrictions may occur years later when challenged, complained about or publically exposed.
•	Agency may not be fully informed of privacy requirements, thus setting incorrect access restrictions - even though they know their business. Strengthen/establish a partnership on peer review with Privacy Commissioner and Government Chief Privacy Officer.
Strengthen privacy roles and responsibilities across agencies.
•	There is a need for more of a hybrid relationship between Archives New Zealand and the agency, making Archives New Zealand act like a portfolio manager with additional responsibilities for access status classifications.

											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												•	Yes, this must be prescriptive and not subject to interpretation. Archival silences will get larger with digital as the volume, variety and velocity of information is increasing exponentially.
•	Have an all-of-government approach.
•	Review and incorporate the List of Protected Records for local authorities.
•	Review the List of Protected Records for local authorities, for relevance.
•	There is a need for more general disposal authorities at a national level.
•	There is a need for agency-specific general disposal authorities to be approved by Archives New Zealand.

											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												•	Yes, compliance should be by design. The tax office model is a good example as it makes it easy for people comply. Specific compliance requirements are then able to be met by default negating the requirement for complicated procedural approaches. Additionally promotes standardisation.
•	Can’t drop the ball on recordkeeping regulation and apply resources. All eggs can’t be in one basket as one size doesn’t fit all.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												•	Archives New Zealand are not significantly different to any other similar agency globally. Developing capability in-house creates knowledge silos. Crowd sourcing development leveraging expertise globally promotes open innovation and collaboration.
•	Something for Archives NZ Management to address.
•	Incorporate a hybrid approach having in-house capability and work through/with others, but remain a leader.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												•	Very prescriptive. There could also be more standards for community archives and archives managed by trusts: it is important to address the sectors in society who are creating or managing significant New Zealand archives.
•	The New Zealand recordkeeping-community that is accountable to Archives New Zealand is looking for more descriptive documentation from Archives New Zealand. 
•	Voluntary standards actively promote optionality and in constrained times are unfeasible to implement.
•	The voluntary standards could be better articulated through specific guides and advisory procedures.
•	Should go further and include regular compliance audits for all government agencies.
Buy In from Leadership with Compliance
•	Local government needs to be treated the same as the public sector in its accountability under the Public Records Act and the Audit Programme.
•	Archives New Zealand to provide more leadership and guidance on the use of data and records. There is a lack of national case studies regarding common projects, services, operational management, or improvement strategies.
•	Archives New Zealand to provide more information strategies and knowledge management practices to lift the maturity and compliance.
•	Raise the importance of public exposure (name and shame from the public) to get more buy-in from executive leadership about knowing important risks regarding information management.
•	Archival repositories for local authorities’ process needs to change. Archives New Zealand must consider allowing local authorities to undertake transfers (physical and electronic) to Archives New Zealand. If Archives New Zealand is the keeper of “permanent” government records, what about local authorities?

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Collaboration and Partnerships
•	Archives New Zealand need to expand their work internationally - Supporting regional and thematic partnerships.
•	Archives New Zealand to strengthen working with external experts academic, business sectors, community heritage sector, archival trusts and independent establishments.
•	Not all of the professional community is represented through participation with the professional bodies. Challenge for Archives New Zealand is to identify sources of expertise.
•	Archives New Zealand is expected to be a more confident leader.

Drive Information, Records and Data Intelligence
•	Archives New Zealand needs to address how it can collect robust data for trend analysis and factual advice.
•	Archives New Zealand should look into how it can harness exploiting qualitative and quantitative data to enable evidence-based outcomes and business cases relating to national work.
•	Use of advocacy tools, such as case studies and campaigns, to make the case for archives. 
•	More benchmarking surveys and questionnaires is required on the state of the nation's recordkeeping.
•	Reinstate yearly questionnaires or self-assessments from agencies accountable for the Public Records Act 2005.
Conclusion
Change is difficult for government staff and the public. The human factor is the primary reason paper based approaches are still in effect but demand from the public for a paper free agency environments is increasing. This is directly resulting in digital transformation initiatives being executed by agencies without good regulation.

Will there be national roadshows as a follow up to this method of engagement?
Will Archives New Zealand explore ideas in more detail during the next phase, so that “we” as the public community co-create with Archives New Zealand to deliver the strategy?

												There already exist standard ‘access status classifications’ for government documentation, for example as set out in the Cabinet Manual 2008 and the New Zealand Government Security Classification System. There is no need to develop further classifications.

Where work is required is on training and education to ensure that all government agencies use the standard ‘access status classifications’ consistently.

There also needs to be more guidance on when either individual agencies or Archives New Zealand will release information into the public domain. (For example, all documents placed in the National Archives in the UK have a release date of 10, 20, 30 or 40 years after the date the document was created.)

												Archives NZ in its role as guardian of Government and public records does need a long term strategy for the management, retention care and access to such records. This document heads in the right direction with addressing these issues. An area only touched upon lightly in the discussion is the long term access to records by researchers.  The Universal Declaration on Archives recognizes "the unique quality of archives as authentic evidence of administrative, cultural and intellectual activities and as a reflection of the evolution of societies". This nicely sums up the call of researchers to repositories like Archives NZ. 

Providing long term access for researchers to records in analogue and electronic format should be a key focus in this strategy. Researchers will always need a well serviced reading room providing access to, and expert advice for, historic records. Even though current records are primarily created electronically I cannot see the demand for historic analogue records declining.

Digitisation is one way to make analogue records available remotely but the volume of records means only limited documents will be scanned.  

Electronic records are more problematic. While there is a push for Government records to be made available online it is difficult to see this applying to the electronic records held by Archives. Even for records that are out of restriction, author and third party copyright will almost certainly records being published online. Personal privacy and cultural sensitives beyond embargo will also limit what is made accessible. For the researcher this will mean still coming to the Archives' reading to consult electronic records on Archives' computers. Where electronic records are held in agencies it is likely researchers will need to go to agencies to access information. Thought needs to be given to how researchers and Archives NZ adapts in this changing digital environment.

											<div>
												More “approved repositories” (or a more proactive approach to approving repositories) will help local communities access records of local interest (eg School records). This could be supported by maintaining information about Public records held in approved repositories in Archway (or successor) or otherwise via an agency/repository neutral finding aid - even if reference is only at a series or other broad level. In many cases Public Records are already held in local Museums and Archives – and I feel that it is more appropriate and respectful to acknowledge the importance of this information to local communities – and to support appropriate archival practice locally - than it is to attempt to “centralise” collections.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												“Data” of “archival value” may tend to reside with the collecting agency rather than being transferred to an archival institution – in which case Archives New Zealand may be better to help facilitate open government initiatives and to developing agency neutral finding aids or indexes. 

There is a need for requirements for Digital transfer of information so that they can be transferred with appropriate contextual information to facilitate discovery.  This may be quite problematic with respect to “documents” as agencies move past folder style classifications to metadata and annotation driven schema.

											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												In general agencies will have a better understanding of any privacy/security issues in information transferred and in many cases this will be designed into systems at source. However, this can lead to inconsistencies in access rules between analogous record sets. At present it is difficult to coordinate access arrangements across collections held across Archives NZ Offices so I would suggest that Archives address this at least.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												“Evidence based decision making” requires maintenance and accessibility of evidence sources (data). Hence a more explicit approach to retention rules and methods for data collections over time may be required. Whether Archives is an appropriate agency to retain such expertise on “how” to achieve this is debatable – but ,may fall into the Ambit of DIA/GCIO in time.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Procedures in the case of merged agencies are established (nomination of successor agency). In the case of agencies which actually cease to exist - without a successor - this can be very difficult without resources to directly intervene. It is best to ensure that transfers are regular and timely so that residual archival information is minimised in the event of an agencies untimely demise. This is proving problematic with respect to physical transfers at present due to space restrictions. 
Protecting important data and digital sources in this scenario seems problematic – though in the case of core functions it must be assumed that an agency will continue to deliver that function and so be obliged and willing to protect important data sources.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												If these archival silences can be defined such that agencies can take appropriate action then this should be positive, however in many instances the situation may be beyond redemption. We would assume that the process to establish and review Disposal Authorities and Retention Schedules would provide ample opportunity for Archives to ensure that records of archival value are adequately identified. Consideration could be given to more active monitoring of implementation of schedules and tracking of transfers against those schedules – perhaps down to the specific disposal class, though this could be resource intensive and begs the question as to how Archives might define a failure to comply with a Disposal Authority and how they might act to ensure this is remedied. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												This might be best achieved by an alignment with (wider) DIA GCIO Information Architecture initiatives - possibly to the extent of a unified "Information and Records Management" "compliance" and best practice framework. In the digital age the distinction between “Information” and “records” is blurry of not spurious, so I do not think that much in this space can be achieved with “record keeping” system design. I’d suggest that an agreed set of system requirements may be more beneficial than system design unless Archives (or DIA) wish to act in an active consultancy role in this respect.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I don’t think this is a core service of Archives NZ other than contributing to and influencing DIA led initiatives – though as above (and probably also best delivered under the DIA/GCIO banner) , requirements sets (for data, document, and web management) may be helpful.  
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Mandatory standards are only truly mandatory if they are enforceable. That said, a robust standard like the late great S2 (storage standard) is can be very useful when contracting external services.
Irrespective of the status of a standard compliance is inevitably a value proposition for an agency so the standards should be couched in terms of the business benefits of compliance.

											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Good design is a start. Good design allows me to use Archway usefully from home. Perhaps material as well as indexes can be digitised so that we can access it from home. I am lucky to live in Wellington but we also need to bear in mind a user living in country area.

											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Everyone thinks his/her situation is unique but my experience tells me that's not true.

The system should be designed to suit the expected user rather than the department who is archiving the material.

											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Most people have access to the Internet from their home device. For those who do not most public libraries provide Internet access at a reasonable cost. The advantage of the Internet, particularly if fibre gets out to the remoter areas, is its accessibility compared with the visiting of one of Archives' four offices.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Departments need to be imbued with the philosophy of the Official Information Act. Historians must be able to look back on past Governmental actions and make judgements on their value. Presumably governments in New Zealand will not make important decisions in camera except perhaps with regards to Internal Security. Even there I believe something like the British 30-year rule should apply.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Certain people employed by Government have responsibilities that are beyond those they owe to the Government of the day. The Chief Ombudsman and the Auditor-General are 2 such people. I believe the Chief Archivist should also be an officer of Parliament rather than a public servant.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes, I believe the Chief Archivist should be authorised to direct Departmental Heads how their records are to be kept and which ones should be retained and passed to Archives New Zealand. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I think both aspects are important. A well-designed filing system helps a department to access important information quickly and make better decisions. But there is always the temptation to hide things that didn't go so well so that regulation is also important.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I think it is such a key aspect that there should be a strong in-house capability but that does not preclude using outside people from time to time.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I think there is a base that needs to be mandatory. Voluntary standards may be acceptable if the information affected is of little value.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?

											<div>
												Sometimes the physical object adds value. My uncle died as 13-year-old in drowning tragedy at Kaka Point in January 1912. I had the opportunity of seeing the actual file for the Coroner's Inquest report. The pages had come from a school pad and the "Coroner" was a local justice of the peace. Handling that report was a strong emotional and informative experience. I can no longer see more than a facsimile of that report but I am  grateful for my one opportunity. I can understand Archives New Zealand's reluctance to allow that access indefinitely.

												The discussion of the place of Archives NZ in forty years’ time is an important conversation to have. We are approaching the consultation by framing 2057 not as the start point but rather as the end point. Our thoughts are based on potential evolutions in Archives NZ practice between now and then, not on a big bang reinvention. 

It would be a pity if the 2057 project became an inward-focussed exercise concerned predominantly with digitisation methods, storage options, record-keeping systems, information management processes and whole of government practices, i.e. matters of moment to the organisation itself. This would neglect the need to remain focussed on the very purpose and objectives of modern and responsive government record keeping.

A helpful balance can be achieved by keeping the <u>users</u> of archives firmly in perspective alongside the creators and stewards of government records.

The discussion document is also silent on the question of fees, charges, and user costs. If this discussion document is not the place for such finely-grained discussion, we anticipate any initiatives in this area would be the subject of further consultation.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Archives NZ is not required to be an agency of inspiration. Its strengths are connecting with others, providing information, and enabling story-telling by Archives users in homes, schools, workplaces and marae. 

With regard to history, our field of interest, Archives NZ has a small army of story tellers, professional and amateur, who support the kaupapa of the agency and want it to perform to its full potential.

Archives NZ does not need to do the ‘inspirational’ stuff alone. It can and should seek partnerships with people in other agencies, such as:
•	academics; 
•	researchers in the public service and the galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) sector; 
•	runanga and other iwi organisations; and 
•	non-government organisations (NGOs) such as unions or philanthropic service groups. 

Examples of Archives NZ partnerships, at a reasonably small cost, include:
•	co-sponsored conferences or exhibitions;
•	an in-house research fellows’ scheme;
•	annual writing awards or sponsorship of an archives-related category in the NZ Book Awards/Ockham awards. 

These would be relatively ‘easy wins’ and would be an important profile-raising exercise.

We also encourage Archives NZ to play a central role in assisting with commemorations of the NZ Wars by pro-actively looking for opportunities to identify, analyse and share the information it holds. This could be a five to twenty year project. The effort required for the WWI digitisation is instructive, yet was narrowly focussed on pre-formatted military records. The NZ Wars commemorations cross into land records, police and prison records, military records in NZ and the UK, and colonial office records amongst others. Many are also written in te reo.

The private sector could be prevailed upon to fulfil a wider notion of citizenship, by contributing through sponsorship or partnerships in some form, once questions about equity of access to information are addressed.

											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Our comments are not confined to born-digital records but encompass physical records too.

The current four public reading rooms must remain open and staffed sufficiently by trained and engaged staff to provide help when required. Consideration could be given to making greater use of public libraries outside the four main centres, which could serve as hubs for specialist Archives NZ outreach programmes. 

We also encourage Archives NZ to consider offering access to reading rooms on a Saturday, even if only for a half day, as provided by the Alexander Turnbull and National Libraries in Wellington. 

The reading room at the Sir George Grey Special Collections in Auckland is open Saturday, and the Hocken Collections reading room in Dunedin is open seven days. Both agencies have what might be considered early government records in their collections.

These suggestions take a broad view of what ‘accessible’ looks like for those who do not live in the four main centres, or those who have work, school and family commitments Mon-Fri.

The reading rooms offer a powerful symbolic presence of Archives NZ’s place in the community. Your ‘shopfront’ has to be more than a digital portal and an email address to contact a helpdesk. Archives NZ would become increasingly inaccessible if researchers and users had to rely on the goodwill of a remote archivist answering a stream of emails. Such a system also privileges those people who are more proficient in written language and digital communications. 

Kanohi ki te kanohi – face to face contact - is an important foundational concept of the Crown’s relationship with citizens.

												Government agencies have displayed a lack of understanding and a patchy commitment to accessibility - for example for historical scholarship. 

It should not be necessary for any government agency to see or to sign off the work of an historian, or sociologist as in the case of Dr Jarrod Gilbert (NZ Police), before it is published. 

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has unduly restrictive practices around access to public records, in one case it allowed a researcher to view  records from 1929 but forbade her from taking notes! Please don’t make us resort to the Official Information Act to access such records.

												The discussion document is heavily weighted towards planning for a digital future. Great! Born-digital records are indeed the next frontier.

But research into nineteenth and twentieth century New Zealand life remains vibrant and persistent. Those records remain paper-based and there is no sign of the massive digitisation project required for these documents. This reinforces the arguments in favour of maintaining and strengthening the services provided by the reading rooms.

We particularly point to section 3(f) and (g) of the Public Records Act which envisaged enhanced accessibility to our cultural heritage; and encouragement of the notion of partnership and goodwill envisaged by the Treaty.

												We agree that the pragmatic solution to managing the digital record of government, both now and in the future, is to support agencies and/or sectors to preserve and manage their own digital records, particularly where there is an established and regular exchange of information and data as part of standard business practice. 

Archives’ support should be in the areas of:
•	standard setting and good practice
•	mandating/designing AOG records systems, standards and solutions. 
•	regulatory/audit services across government.  

To date Archives NZ has not had a role in data preservation which we feel has been a core gap in their collection policy. So the idea of agency-managed digital archives addresses this gap. LINZ and Statistics NZ and others are already preserving data. 

While we agree that there will be an ongoing requirement for standard setting, regulation and system advice and support for government record-keepers, it seems less likely that provision of this service would require a separate archival agency. The wider DIA is very active across government in the fields of system design and support, in providing leadership in standard-setting and good practice, in the management of open data, and in providing leadership across the full range of technological development for government.  More integration into the DIA (and with National Library) would benefit Archives NZ to avoid losing information management leadership and leverage off other projects and initiatives.

We agree that existing physical records will continue to require appropriate management. Where and how that should be done should be critically examined. It seems likely that management of physical records of long-term cultural and social records will be centred in one agency or repository manager.  The roles of Archives NZ and National library as standalone entities have a limited lifespan and that consolidation into one service is likely and prudent.

											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The government record is in fact part of the general record of life in NZ, and more value would be delivered to the communities in question if the source of cultural, historical and social information they are interested in was available from a single source – such as a agency agnostic portal. Encouraging new users is primarily a communication and education function and requires an intelligent appreciation of their needs and, in some cases, their technological capability. We believe it would be more valuable for Archives to contribute to all-of-government initiatives to improve access to a diverse range of resources from a single, user-friendly source than to concentrate on building expertise and online resources specific to their own collections in isolation. 
Since Archives predicts that agencies will continue to manage their own digital resources over time, it makes more sense for them to contribute to all-of-government education and communication programmes addressing current information and data options, and to leverage off other agencies expertise in promotion and access. 

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												As Archives unique digital collections are relatively small compared with the rest of government, we believe that Archives best option is to be actively involved across government in the development of access portals that lead into large government collections. 
Having just completed a comprehensive audit of central and local government agencies’ information holdings, and with DIA hosting an initiative to consolidate Information Asset Registers for all of government in their environment, Archives staff are perfectly placed to make valuable contributions to all of government and sector initiatives to enhance the value and accessibility of government records for New Zealanders.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												In most cases agencies know their own information best including the potential risks involved in making confidential or private information available without moderation. In the case of Statistics NZ, we are aware of the risks around releasing data that isn’t confidentialised, fully and accurately described and the variables behind its collection made explicit.  It’s not only a matter of public trust, it’s also a responsibility to ensure that the public is fully informed. 
There are occasions when agencies can be overly protective, including situations where they over-estimate the need for security or for long-term retention. On the whole, however, agencies usually make pragmatic decisions balancing the needs of both the information holder and the requestor. 
Archives clearly has a role in setting standards and providing guidelines – as do other agencies such as GCSB and the Office of the Ombudsman. As part of their current function, Archives vets individual Disposal Schedules to question clear anomalies that internal and external consultation may have missed. Continuing this level of oversight would be valuable and support regulatory oversight. 

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												This can be done with the right systems and expertise. While Archives can give advice on the management of all information types, we would recommend that any agencies working with pure data would be better off dealing with specialist agencies who can give practical operational advice based on a deep knowledge of the relevant international standards.

												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?

											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												It’s difficult to see how any government agency could implement a more prescriptive regime effectively without developing a strong investigative arm backed by significant penalties. While agencies might run a reputational risk if important records are disposed of early, some may consider that the slight chance of discovery is worth the saved investment and others, such as small agencies, might have no alternative if their human and financial resources are limited. 
Most agencies err on the side of caution in disposing of important records (both in their Disposal Schedules and in their application of them) – and all agencies are aware of what their key records are.  
Archives should continue their education opportunities, particularly for new entrants to the recordkeeping environment. It would also be useful, with the proliferation of small agencies with limited budgets, to consider offering a more tailored service that will support small agencies in meeting their current obligations. 

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Appropriate system design is fundamental to the proposed decentralised model. With the breadth of work being done in the system development and review space in DIA, Archives would benefit from more interaction and shared projects within their own agency (DIA). Mandated records capabilities for systems that are expected to be adopted under the ‘as a service’ model would be an ideal starting point to ensure this future model is adoptable.
The guidance Archives currently provide on information management is an important resource for government, but we would suggest that Archives broaden their focus to include both more detailed system knowledge and better knowledge of related fields such as data management.  Secondments to expert agencies would be of benefit to Archives’ staff development and increase the knowledge base for Archives.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												To a large extent we have answered this question above.  We feel Archives expertise would be of more benefit in bringing their expertise to joint agency or larger DIA-led initiatives in this area where they could both inform and learn. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Mandatory standards have effect when they are seen to be of value to the business (i.e. the cost of implementing does not outweigh the perceived risk) and that they are enforceable. Archives current has little power to enforce behaviours and must rely on persuasion and education. This is especially true in an environment of shrinking financial and human resources.   Agencies are focused on delivering more for increasingly less, and their bottom line is often driven by the Statement of Performance Expectations from the Minister and their share of the relevant Vote.      
If Archives can demonstrate a positive benefit to agencies from adopting prescribed Standards, and those Standards are practical and make business sense, then agencies will respond positively. The current balance – a small number of well-explained Standards and Disposal Authorities - makes a useful tool set for information management professionals.   The addition of a regular self-audit regime that can be used to inform internal business planning will enhance that perceived benefit
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Overall, we agree with the major predictions for change in the recordkeeping and archival environment. However, with the rapid rate of change in the technological environment, projecting ahead forty years is of questionable value in terms of detail.   
Once Archives has a clearly stated vision of its fundamental purpose within the government sector, then how that vision is implemented can adapt to the coming changes in mood, income and technology without losing focus or validity
