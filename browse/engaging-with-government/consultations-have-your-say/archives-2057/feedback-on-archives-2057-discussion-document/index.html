											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Create multiple ways of engaging with material, including different access methods and portals. Records can held in multiple places and in multiple ways, as long as the integrity of the record is maintained and systems cater for records such as sound and moving image having different requirements than other digitized and born-digital material.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												- By providing contextual information to help people navigate records
- Providing educational opportunities
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Arrangement and description that support Māori accessing material in ways that make sense to them
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												- Agencies may be more aware where sensitive material might be
- Agencies have first-hand relationships with third parties (for example iwi) who should be consulted about access
- It could however lead to inconsistencies in approach between agencies
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												- Pro-active and consistent education around responsible record-keeping
- Some regulation, including a balance of mandatory and voluntary standards
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Documentation of the historical record-keeping systems that document the pathways to the new systems to provide a continuum of information.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Documentation of the historical record-keeping systems that document the pathways to the new systems to provide a continuum of information.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												While Archive NZ should lead this work, it is important that interested communities have input into decision-making. There may be reasons for retaining or disposing of records that can only be fully appreciated by the people who were part of the creation of that record.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												A balance of both, with a move towards system design as record-keeping practices improve.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Working collaboratively has many advantages as it is difficult to build expertise across the wide range of records being created.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												A balanced approach that allows for some flexibility as not all scenarios can be covered.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?

I would like to see Archives open during the weekends; if not each weekend at least once a month. I would be prepared to pay for this access.
There are some documents such as State Forest files which could be made available at , for example Waikato University. The cost of the courier could be paid by the researcher.
Thank you.

												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												First of all, I would question the exclusive focus on the record of government. NZ needs a long term record of other things as well. Long term, Archives NZ should be thinking about individual, family, community, business, Iwi, and NGO archives as well.

I would also question the idea that these communities are only in NZ. We have an increasingly large group of NZers who live overseas. NZ has the second largest proportion of citizens living overseas in the world, after Ireland. This presents opportunities for the future.



											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I think more could be made of opportunities for partnership between government and other organisations, such as Iwi. We need a connected system for access and reuse of records over time. archives has an important role in coordinating and leading this system.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?

											<div>
												See comments on partnership above.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Agencies know their own business. However, over time functions and attitudes change. An argument could be made that after a certain number of years standard freedom of information and privacy considerations no longer apply, and access is managed under archival legislation. This would require Archives NZ to become much more expert in this area.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												As far as I can tell, Archives NZ is not currently an important part of the government data ecosystem. Statistics NZ's world-leading IDI initiative carries out many of the same functions that would in the past have been achieved by a national archive. This is a key strategic threat and opportunity for Archives NZ. How does the national archive support better data management and data use across government? If Archives NZ cannot add value here it will eventually become irrelevant.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Not really sure what is meant here.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Archives NZ, together with partners, could be providing a service which assisted agencies with mergers, etc. More could also be done to clarify the accountabilities and responsibilities of senior executives.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The current model of influencing retention priorities through disposal authorisation does not seem to be working well. A different model which identified what records are of high long term value and which must be managed well could work better. The tier one statistics model used by Statistics NZ is a useful example of such a model.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												System design is the wrong focus - I would suggest "service design". This highlights the importance of people and business process as well as technology.

Archives NZ also needs to think about the following issues: how to build the capability of the public sector and archives systems in NZ over time; how to simplify and improve frameworks for the management of public sector information; and how to raise awareness of these issues with senior leadership.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												It should do both. The goal should be to influence the way new and existing services are designed and implemented. Government needs inspiring information leadership to transform the way services are delivered and information is used. Archives should be a part of that.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Standards should only be mandatory when this supports real, valuable outcomes for citizens. This may require a more subtle approach - for instance only insisting on full compliance for very high value collections.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?
											</h4>
											<div>
												This document is a good start, but I have some concerns: I do not think it is ambitious enough for a 40 year strategy. It seems to ignore any role for Archives NZ in leading the wider archives sector, outside government. And I feel it is still too much in the world of words and documents rather than datasets and services.

											<div>
												Having records available in digital format is very helpful to genealogist especially if they are scanned. Transcribed records, despite the best intention of the transcibers, have mistakes. Genealogists need to be able to go back to original records which may have been scanned but preferably are the actual documents.  To be able to read/hold the original records allows a greater understanding of area of research being undertaken.

												Consider meaningful data clusters. This is important if government organisations are crossing over Iwi boundaries.  Government organisational boundaries change often, resulting in difficulties for Iwi with more stable geographical coverage to extract meaningful data.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Target areas of high risk in government and local government. This may be size related, i.e. limited resources; lack of disposal schedules; lack of transfer programmes;  lack of digital disposal embedded in systems storing records. Provide the additional resources to support this. Ensure the whole of government information group has the resources to investigate new technology and make clear recommendations linked up with the procurement people. It is essential that government takes the lead in ensuring technology systems are 'fit-for-purpose'; I believe most organisation, focused on core functional requirements, do not have this capability either in competencies, money, time, or senior management interest or confidence. In support of small organisations - they can be excellent ing providing single focus in key core functional deliverables - however the overheads of ensuring business technology solutions incorporate adequate recordkeeping requirements mean they may need the support of centralised infrastructure support. Even larger organisation may need this support as well. This could be in providing pre-vetted solutions, i.e. develop existing services being offer further; or the provision of specialist formal customised assessment and advise. I feel resourcing this area is very important because in my experience the recordkeeping ability of technology lags a good number of years behind new technology. Asking individual organisations to design, development and built required 'add-ins' on a 'one off' basis wastes government money.  Poor design results in records not being created and managed meaning poor accessibility.  When information is 'captured' in back-up systems it's almost impossible to get rid of the low value 95% 'clutter' that needs to be destroyed in order to retain and access the 'good-stuff' if recordkeeping frameworks aren't in place. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Assign an advisor and digital specialist, as well as disposal specialist. Create an internal management plan. Check back with the transfer and receiving agencies on progress and risks until the transfer is complete (this can be some years down the track). Where risk is high, ensure the Chief Archivist gives directions to report - to the person responsible - the Administrative head, not the records staff. This supports information and records staff in gaining resources to continue recordkeeping continuity over extended periods of time. seful

											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Archives New Zealand already reviews the appraisal reports associated with retention and disposal schedules. I feel this is a resourcing question. Currently, records of national continuing value are selected. This results in economies because fewer archives are collected. There is certainly value in targeting selected areas, particularly high risk digital records, or providing advice and setting expectations for organisations consulting internal and external stakeholders. We also need to consider the capacity of people appraising information and records with the huge changes in bi-cultural expectations over the last decade or so as Archivists become more aware of Maori perspectives and needs. So should Archives NZ set out more precisely? Not necessarily, providing leadership and advice has the potential to make a significance positive impact. This is already done with the Local government protected records list - yet there remain gaps in coverage as risks play out over decades, i.e. if it can happen it probably will. Determining what archives are significant has always been a tricky process, with many records of significant value ending up in Archives by chance. Regularly (5 yearly) doing environmental scans of technology capability, and societal and cultural expectations and developing targeted action plans within Archives New Zealand  would help keep on top of changes in archival value perceptions. Helen Samuels had some useful ideas about significance and collecting - see Cook, T (Ed.) (2011). Controlling the Past: Documenting society and institutions: Essays in honor of Helen Willa Samuels. Chicago: Society of American Archivists.

											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												It took a while to work out what 'design-in' meant and I think others may also have difficulty understanding what it means. Rather than either / or - how about focusing both on regulatory follow up and well as system design. As I said earlier systems design is critical and is definitely a missing element leading to all kinds of bad.  Archives New Zealand actually doesn't have a strong focus on regulation. I think they could make far more use of the powers they have in directions to report and putting the responsibility where is belongs - the Administrative head. If something goes 'belly-up' the specific administrative heads who had responsibility at the time need to be named. It's called reputation damage.  Peer pressure is a useful tool for ensuring compliance gets adequate resourcing. But its not just about compliance, recordkeeping is at it's heart about both good business practices and accountability. Just this morning on Stuff (14/11/2016) was another example of poor recordkeeping. A young women was let off a commercial ferry in Auckland into a locked up wharf at night. In spite of the women's grandmother making a complete the video footage was overwritten (inadequate retention, very poor practice in allowing records to be destroyed with a complaint / investigation underway). The grandmother was very angry about the lack of accountability. This is recordkeeping at it's most 'nitty-gritty'. Archives NZ should use its powers to declare any organisation subject to the OIA or LOIGMA Acts subject to the PRA. The PRA is the foundational framework for meeting OIA/LOIGMA requirements and community expectations. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Absolutely, definitely. Far, far more resources needs to be put into this area (see my earlier comments). Individual organisations just can't do this on their own. We've too small a country, and how organisations and dollars resources are too modest. Are there any opportunities to develop systems in conjunction with Australia (at state and federal levels)? How is Archives NZ building relationships with potential collaborators? This is an areas Archives NZ has previously shown leadership, and needs to 'step-up' again with confidence in what we have to offer.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Meeting recordkeeping requirements will never be about 'follow these 100 rules and everything will be well'. The reality is each organisation is a unique collection of  purpose, infrastructure, environment, information culture, and the values of individuals (see Dr Gillian Olivers, and Foscarini's book and conference paper (Oliver, G, & Foscarini, F. (2014). Records management and information culture: Tackling the people problem. London: Facet Publishing; and conference paper Oliver, G., & Foscarini, F. (2015). Information Culture: An essential concept for next generation records management. Paper presented at the DLM Forum - 7th Triennial Conference, Lisbon, Portugal.) I like to say the answer to any recordkeeping question is always 'how long is a piece of string? It depends.' The missing element here is capability. How capable are the people employed to manage information and records (and lets just throw info & records  together because separating them is unhelpful for management)? As a standard setter Archives NZ can, should, must (?) set benchmarks for appropriate levels of recordkeeping knowledge and skill, combined with the appropriate mix of business (transferable skills), and personal attributes. We have more than our share of 'rules people'. We need to focus on effective implementation prudent business practices and recordkeeping (i.e. Information Culture (Oliver/Foscarini) and recordkeeping informatics - and designing in recordkeeping into systems). Influencing competencies without RK skills=poor business recordkeeping.  The ISO records standard - degrees of authenticity concepts identifies matching value to resources. If we don't care about certain types of info & records then by focusing on least resource intensive ways of getting rid of them means time and energy can be spent on significant records. The requirement for executive sponsors in the new Info and records standard is a genus move, whoever thought of it has made a huge contribution to recordkeeping in NZ.  
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?
											</h4>
											<div>
												'Do we support ‘early assessment for’ – access, preservation, appraisal and disposal?'  Yes, absolutely support early assessment and target risks. Ingest issues are a huge risk and resourcing issue for central and local govt. Local authorities are substantially unsupported in the areas of protected records digital longevity. The national archive is doing cutting edge complex international level digital preservation so a minimum is offering preservation & access as a service to local authorities - they don't have capability to do it themselves. Extend it to community archives (which have little money; how about we invite the ATL provide resources & work collaboratively in leadership). Yes we DO need to accept digital archives well before 25 years, this would mean organisations have to actually DO destruction and disposal. I have only seen rather poor 'design-in' disposal - very  1st generation technology requiring scary massive resources out of proportion to value, i.e. housekeeping clutter, low value records, and issues identifying the 'good stuff'. We also need to up our support for our Pacific neighbours in the interests of justice (protecting the rights of our neighbour citizens). Should we go digital as a country? Of course, but we can't underestimate just how much we need to 'up-our-game' - which means we must invest in adequate resourcing to improve the capability of the people working as recordkeepers. Employers are focused on immediate business value, not medium and long term business recordkeeping requirements. It's hard working in this area and we need capable people with Recordkeeping expertise and the ability to work effectively in this space. Archives NZ should set the benchmark because employers don't know what they need.  Thanks for the opportunity to contribute. Love the work Archives NZ has been doing - keep going with focusing on outcomes and thinking whole-of-government.

												Firstly, congratulations to Marilyn Little and the teams for putting together a strategy document that will lead into the 100 year celebrations of the establishment of the national archive institution.

The discussion document is well timed on the back of the new Recordkeeping Standard and there are certainly strong links between the two in terms of future direction.

While not covered explicitly in the strategy one key area Archives could support the sector on is the recognition of information and data as an ‘asset’ in accounting terms.   

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Online tools need to adapt to the shifting changes within our diverse communities and become responsive to its needs.  Contribution from communities is critical to the network of storytelling and looking at the past to prepare for the future.

An emphasis on digital technology and born digital management and preservation is important not only for agencies but also for the wider community.  It is important that the management of the physical archive, digitised and born digital maintain the relationships to ensure the completeness of the information.

Building capacity in the regions for physical storage could prove to be viable from both an economic perspective for the predicted growth of physical storage requirements.
The dual benefit in this model is creating a greater awareness of the value in public archives in the regions as well as responding to the needs of Iwi to keep Taonga close.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I see the key to achieving this is to work with other Government agencies in ensuring there is consistency across the board with metadata management and standards and collaboration with systems.  This naturally translates to better navigation for people when using and understanding digital content.

The digital archivist will need to work closely with enterprise information architects to ensure appraisal, arrangement and preservation considerations are made in the design or as close to it as possible.

This will require a commitment to a training path for digital archivists.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												There is a recognised level of cynicism towards Government.

Building trust and strong relationship development coupled with a recognition of tikanga and kaupapa will assist in breaking down these barriers.  For Local Government it is important to work with iwi in a manner that reflects this understanding as well as educating non Maori in archival roles in these concepts and application in a recordkeeping concept. 

Aligning access to information with the significance held by Maori for it is important as is protecting access to information that is sensitive from a Maori perspective.  

Funding and access to technology is a barrier for Maori communities to support local archival activities and developing Maori youth in the information management profession.  Support for projects that encourage and develop archival capacity in the regions will break down barriers.


											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The openness of information across all sectors will require a commitment to and agreement on access levels to information.  
Interpretation of other legislation such as the privacy act needs to be consistent and this need is even greater with the increase in born digital information and working in organisations that are digital by default.

Federated access technology across Government will rely on access standardisation.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?

												In Local Government there needs to be more guidance around the creation and disestablishment of Council Controlled organisations and Trusts.  

Towards 2057 there will also need to be standards and guidance on the management of records in a pure shared services model where there is still ownership of the function in the individual Council’s.
Recognition that reviews under section 17A of the Local Government Act 2002 may have an impact on the demand for this support as well.

											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I believe the retention and disposal schedules we work with in the Local Government do need some work on them to update, reflect and remove ambiguity for born digital material.   
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												It needs to be a balance not a shift.
Regulation needs to be in place to inform system design.  The regulation will diminish with better design efforts and the building the capacity within agencies for the same.
I think Archives has a pivotal role in defining standards that should be used – if not mandated at least a strong recommendation with model formats and integration standards e.g. able to transfer between orgs/systems using Web services.

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes.  This is no different than having capability in-house for physical archives space design and management.  

Archives NZ needs to continue to be the go to place for capability to support people out in the field and provide experienced practical advice. 

											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Having mandatory standards is helpful in areas where there is a risk to management of records however prescriptive standards are should be tool for compliance.

Thought leadership and education efforts in all functional areas of Local Government is the key to better understanding of risk and consequence which always leads to a higher level of compliance.  Working closely with organisations such as SOLGM and ALGIM is the key here.

												How do we inspire the many diverse communities in New Zealand to participate, explore and use the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												By having records  of relevance to them and their histories in formats and languages they can access. The diverse communities include the disability community so records need to be available for people who are vision or hearing impaired, cannot read text, need plain language, or do not have access to digital technology. For example surveys such as this one should always be available in NZ Sign Language and in a plain language paper version. The record of government includes records by and about disabled people, disability rights and organisations and data about disability. It also includes records about NZ's eugenic public policies such as histories of institutionalisation and deinstitutionalisation, and pre-natal screening, and campaigns such as that which led to the development of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (into which disabled NZers had significant input as part of the official delegations), and the records of the Independent Monitoring Mechanism for that Convention. The short lived Disability Census and associated data needs to be made available and accessible. The official work behind the development of the NZ ASD Guidelines (particularly by Ministries of Health and Education) are other aspects of our history that could be highlighted. There is also the development of ACC from the 1960s and legislation such as the 1975 Disabled Persons Community Welfare Act.  Our official disability history is readily overlooked and hard to find. A focus on records about disability history and policy would encourage those 24% of NZers who identify as disabled to use them.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How can archivists help people navigate government information, records and archives in a born-digital environment?
											</h4>
											<div>
												The born-digital environment will always exclude some people, eg those people who can't afford the technology, or who can't access it for disability or other reasons. Archivists need to learn ways to help people for whom technology remains largely inaccessible. There is also always the risk that technology becomes inaccessible to everyone after only a few years. Paper will always be important so I suggest that archivists keep paper records wherever possible as they may be the only long lasting or unhackable format for records(especially when kept safe from fire and water).  100 year old paper records are easy to read, whereas 10 year old digital records are inaccessible. Just keep paper.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What barriers exist to Māori accessing and/or managing taonga and government information for cultural and economic benefit?
											</h4>
											<div>
												This answer is for Maori to answer for themselves. I hope there are ongoing mechanisms for engagement with Maori as Treaty partners, as this is an ongoing issue of partnership, participation and protection.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												What are the pros and cons of government agencies setting their own access status classifications?
											</h4>
											<div>
												There must be strong legislation and regulations from the centre so there is uniformity and the best possible access for future historians and researchers. Most government agencies know very little about archival philosophy and access. Few understand the relevance of their records into the future.  An example is how important census data is for all sorts of historical research, but statisticians have not kept the most relevant data out of concerns about privacy - something that is not relevant several decades on. The Public Records Act needs to be strengthened so that individual agencies cannot override the expertise of professional archivists.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if government interventions are based on data?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I'm not sure what this question means - does it mean if the interventions are based on digital data, or does it mean based on 'big data'? Whatever, keep the paper records if/where possible.  There must be ways that digital data, even big data sets can be kept and harvested as required such as from the Cloud. After all, records have to be kept for the purpose of the OIA, so the paper or email or data trails are already in place. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if there are new methods of government decision-making?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Decision-making will remain recorded. It might be that they are recorded more fully and easily by digital means. Smart technology will keep records of all sorts of conversations and transactions.  It is just a matter of enforcing legislation requiring it all to be archived. Even if technology develops to the point where, for example,  everyone has a chip in their brain and no longer needs to read or speak that information is still likely to be recorded somewhere. Good strong laws and some future thinking and planning is required.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How do we ensure important information remains accessible if agencies merge or cease to exist?
											</h4>
											<div>
												This was a real problem in the 1980s and 1990s when so many government agencies ceased or were merged such as school and hospital boards. It seems that many agencies were closed and their records simply tossed out. The problem was actually neo-liberalism and the lack of understanding of a context of past and future. We can learn from that sad experience and ensure, through legislation and by properly resourcing alert professional archivists, to assess and collect records of agencies that merge or close.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand be able to set out, more precisely, what records are to be kept for the long term because there are significant gaps (archival silences) in the record of government?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Yes. Government should properly resource Archives NZ, train more professional archivists and show more respect for the profession,  and strengthen its governance and independence by setting it up as a stand alone government agency away from the dominance of DIA. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Do you think Archives New Zealand should shift the focus of recordkeeping regulation to system design?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Regulation and design are both important - not either or. Just respect and resource the professional archivists to do their job. 
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Should Archives New Zealand develop capability in-house to influence system design or work through others?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Both. In house expertise and collaboration are both important. But NZ archivists are the experts on NZ archives.  Others are unlikely to have that expertise but could perhaps bring in some best practice from eg overseas for NZ to consider.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?
											</h4>
											<div>
												Such things as record keeping have to be highly prescriptive, mandatory and enforced. In most government departments and in politics they are likely to be no ones priority so voluntary would mean little would be kept in reality. Prescriptive means there is at least some instruction to start with.
											</div>
										
									
										
											<h4>
												Any other thoughts you’d like to share?
											</h4>
											<div>
												I remember going over many of these areas in discussions (and there were numerous ones) during the development of the Public Records Act. However, too many aspects in the Act were allowed to be optional/voluntary which has meant much worse archiving and lots of valuable material lost. Be highly prescriptive and if anything err on the side of too much. That will mean at least some records will be kept.

											<h4>
												How prescriptive should Archives New Zealand be around recordkeeping standards (e.g. what should the balance be between voluntary standards versus mandatory requirements)?

											<div>
												Considering that information will become more and more disposable and transient in our lives, the attitude towards preservation of information and people being able to recognise the value of an item will diminish, in my view. I would err on the side of more prescriptive to counteract this.
