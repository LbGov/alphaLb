Information about your intended civil union. 

What are the legal requirements for all civil union ceremonies?

The legal requirements are that:
The civil union must be performed by a Civil Union Celebrant or Registrar of Civil unions at the place(s) specified on the civil union licence;
The civil union must be performed in the presence of at least two witnesses; and
During the ceremony, and before at least two witnesses, each party must make a clear statement that names both parties and acknowledges that they are freely joining in a civil union with each other.
Both parties and witnesses must sign the registration forms (Copy of Particulars of Civil Union).

Both parties must sign the registration forms using their pre-civil union signatures according to their names on the Civil Union Licence. For example, if one party is assuming the other's surname on civil union, that party must sign the registration forms using their usual signature.
Children may act as witnesses if they understand the importance of the part they take in the recording of the civil union and can demonstrate that understanding in court if later required to do so. 

What must the Civil Union Celebrant do at the civil union ceremony?

The Civil Union Celebrant must officiate at the civil union ceremony. This includes:
The formal identification of the parties named on the civil union licence (the celebrant must be satisfied that the persons about to be joined are in fact those named on the civil union licence);
The exchange of the civil union statements;
After both copies of the registration papers (Copy of Particulars of Civil Union) have been signed and witnessed, the Civil Union Celebrant must return the Registrars copy to the issuing Registry Office within 10 calendar days - the couple keep the other copy;
The Civil Union Celebrant must take all reasonable steps to ensure the civil union is registered with Births, Deaths and Marriages.

Persons other than the Civil Union Celebrant may be involved in the ceremony by, for instance, reading a poem.

There should be no doubt in the eyes of the couple, witnesses and attendees that the civil union ceremony was performed by a Civil Union Celebrant.

Registry Office Ceremonies.

Please be aware if you are considering having a Registry Office ceremony that they are standardised to meet the legislative requirements of entering into a civil union, which includes standard civil union statements. There are limitations on the time the ceremony takes (usually 10 minutes), the space for guests and other persons may not generally be involved in the ceremony. Contact the Registry Office where you intend to enter into a civil union to discuss the arrangements. You may book a Registry Office ceremony at the same time as you give notice of your intended civil union and pay the fee.
