Request, Reinstate or Withdraw a Non-Disclosure Direction. 

Notes. 
Non-Disclosure Direction.
A non-disclosure direction may be requested to be placed on a person’s records if the person (i.e. the subject of the record), or his or her personal representative (refer next page for description), reasonably believes that disclosure of the registered information, or any part of the registered information, would be prejudicial to the personal safety of that person or his or her family.

A non-disclosure direction expires after 5 years unless it is reinstated or withdrawn. A non-disclosure direction may be requested to be reinstated for further periods of 5 years if the circumstances relating to personal safety continue to exist.

Births, Deaths and Marriages will not contact you if the non-disclosure direction is about to expire. It is the responsibility of the subject or his or her personal representative to request a reinstatement of a non-disclosure direction.

If a non-disclosure direction is in place on a person’s record(s), generally only the person who is the subject of the information or their personal representative, may access registered information on the record(s). If any other person attempts to access registered information when a non-disclosure direction is in place he or she will be advised that the information exists but that the information cannot be provided.

There is no fee to request, reinstate or withdraw a non-disclosure direction. 

Request or Reinstate a Non-Disclosure Direction.
To request a non-disclosure direction or a reinstatement of a non-disclosure direction you must complete this form (BDM132), a General Identity Declaration form (BDM130), and any additional documentation as required if you are the person’s personal representative. You must also provide one or more of the following as a certified true copy or original document:

Protection order that is in force under the Domestic Violence Act 1995.
Restraining order that is in force under the Harassment Act 1997.
Police report or statutory declaration from a member of the Police to the effect that he or she believes that your personal safety, or that of your families, could be prejudiced by the disclosure of your registered information.
Letter from either a Barrister or Solicitor, your employer, a Registered Medical Doctor, a Justice of the Peace, or the like, supporting your application on the grounds that your personal safety, or that of your families, could be prejudiced by the disclosure of your registered information.
Statutory Declaration stating the facts and some other evidence that satisfies the Registrar-General that your personal safety, or that of your families, could be prejudiced by the disclosure of your registered information.
 
Withdraw a Non-Disclosure Direction.
To withdraw a non-disclosure direction you must complete this form (BDM132), a General Identity Declaration form (BDM130), and any additional documentation as required if you are the person’s personal representative. 
Notes continued.
Personal Representative.
A “personal representative” means:
• a parent or guardian of a person, if that person (being the subject of the record) has not attained the age of 18 years and has not earlier married nor entered into a civil union or de facto relationship; or
• a person who has been granted a power of attorney or has been given written authority by the subject of the record, if the subject has attained the age of 18 years or has earlier married or entered into a civil union or de facto relationship. 

Documents the personal representative must provide (if applicable).
If the personal representative is a parent or guardian of the subject of the record and the subject’s birth information is registered in New Zealand: State this in a signed letter.
If the personal representative is a parent or guardian of the subject of the record and the subject’s birth information is registered outside New Zealand: Provide a certified true copy of the child’s birth certificate, which must name the parents (include a translation if not in English).
If the personal representative is a parent or guardian of the subject of the record and was appointed a testamentary guardian by a deceased parent under section 26(2) of the Care of Children Act 2004 or section 7(2) of the Guardianship Act 1968: Provide a certified true copy of the deed or will.
If the personal representative is a parent or guardian of the subject of the record and is a Court appointed/approved guardian: Provide a certified true copy of the Court appointment/approval. 
If the personal representative has been granted a power of attorney or has been given written authority by the subject of the record, attach a certified true copy of the power of attorney; or
written authority.

Information Made Public while Non-Disclosure Direction in Force.
If you have a non-disclosure direction in force on your registered information and you make any part of your information, or any information corresponding to that part of the information, publicly available then any person may request that Births, Deaths and Marriages verify whether the information that has become publicly available matches, or is consistent with, the relevant registered information.
