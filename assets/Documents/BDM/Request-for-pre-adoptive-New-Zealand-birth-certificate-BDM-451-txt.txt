Request for Pre-Adoptive New Zealand Birth Certificate.
Tono Tiwhikete Whānau o Aotearoa i Mua i te Whāngaitanga

When a person has been legally adopted in New Zealand, the birth certificate normally issued is the post-adoptive birth certificate, showing the details of the adoptive parents. 

If you are born in New Zealand and adopted in New Zealand, and are 20 years of age or older, you may complete this form to request a copy of your original, pre-adoptive birth certificate, showing the details of your birth before you were adopted. 

Your pre-adoptive, original, birth certificate is issued in accordance with the Adult Adoption Information Act (“AAI Act”) 1985, and will be stamped “Issued for the Purposes of the Adult Adoption Information Act 1985”.

Who may request a pre-adoptive birth certificate.
Only the adopted person may request their pre-adoptive birth certifi cate (once 20 years of age or older).

Parent may not wish their information be given to adoptee.
If you were adopted before 1 March 1986, either of your original birth parents may request that their identifying information not be given to you. Each such request expires after 10 years unless earlier removed or reinstated on request of that parent.

Counselling. 
The process by which your request is managed depends on the date you were adopted - we will not know this until after we have received your request. The process will be either of:

Adopted before 1 March 1986.
If you were adopted before 1 March 1986 you must first receive counselling from a social worker or approved person or organisation (unless you are living overseas). Births, Deaths and Marriages will post your pre-adoptive birth certificate and contact details to your chosen counsellor and they will give you your certificate.

Adopted on or after 1 March 1986.
If you were adopted on or after 1 March 1986 we will offer you counselling, but you may ask that the pre-adoptive birth certificate be sent directly to you if you do not desire counselling. As required by the AAI Act 1985, if you do not require counselling we will post you a letter advising you that we are holding your pre-adoptive birth certificate on your behalf, and another letter requesting you confirm your decision not to have counselling.

List of social workers, approved persons or organisations (i.e. counsellor).
The list of approved counsellors is included below. Alternatively, you may contact us and we will send you the list. Please phone your chosen counsellor first to make sure they are available to assist you.
