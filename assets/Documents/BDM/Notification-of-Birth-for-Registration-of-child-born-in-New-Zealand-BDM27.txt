Why register?
Every birth in New Zealand must be registered by law. Please register the birth of your child as soon as possible. We expect you to register
the birth within two months. Both parents must jointly register the birth, with some exceptions. Birth registration is the first official step that confirms whether your child is a New Zealand citizen. You will not be sent any confirmation that the birth has been registered, however, you
can purchase a birth certificate (see order form on the last page).

How to register the birth.
You may register the birth online at smartstart.services.govt.nz or use this form.
Please take care filling out this form as if you make a mistake you will need to pay for a new birth certificate to be issued, if required. Name
change fees will also apply.

• Print the names of your child the way you would like them to appear on a birth certificate.
• Leave a space between names or words.
• Answer all questions in the form truthfully. It is against the law to give false information.
• Please ensure that all relevant questions are completed.
• When you have completed the form, post it to:
Birth Registrations Online, Births, Deaths and Marriage, PO Box 10526, Wellington 6143.

What does it cost?
Registration is free. However there is a fee for a Birth Certificate.

Privacy.
Information regarding the registration of your child’s birth is collected under the Births, Deaths, Marriages, and Relationships Registration
Act 1995 (’the Act’). Both parents are primarily responsible for notifying the birth as soon as practicable. It is an offence, punishable by a
fine, to fail or refuse to provide information for the registration of a birth.

The citizenship or immigration details of the parent(s) of a child born on or after 1 January 2006 will be checked against databases held by
the Department of Internal Affairs (Citizenship Office, Passports Office or Births, Deaths and Marriages), the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (Immigration) and / or with registration authorities in the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau (where relevant). The information will be used to confirm whether your child is a New Zealand citizen by birth.

If you decide to use this form to also apply for an IRD number for your child, Births, Deaths, and Marriages will give the information you have provided on this form to Inland Revenue for this purpose. After giving the information to Inland Revenue, Births, Deaths and Marriages will not retain details of your IRD number if you have provided it on this form.

If you have decided to notify the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) of your child’s birth, Births, Deaths and Marriages will provide MSD with information about the birth when the registration is complete. MSD will use this information to determine how your new baby changes the benefits and services you are entitled to.
After giving the information to MSD, Births Deaths and Marriages will not retain details of your MSD client number if you provided it on this form.

The birth information collected on this form will be held on a public register. The Act governs access to registered birth information. Information about a named individual may generally be accessed by any person upon application (e.g. as a certificate or printout).
Information may be released for statistical, or genuine health or demographic research in the public interest, or to certain government agencies, as authorised by law. Information about why the information is collected, the government agencies that are authorised to receive the information, and about a person's right to access and, where appropriate, correct the information, is available on our web site www.govt.nz/bdm, or Freephone 0800 22 52 52.

Child.
Child’s names to appear on a Birth Certificate (questions 1 & 2 below).
Note.
Your child must be registered with a surname or family name, and one or more given names.

The name (or combination of names) may not be accepted for registration if, in the opinion of the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths
and Marriages (or the Family Court on appeal);
• it might cause offence to a reasonable person; or
• it is unreasonably long (that is, it should be less than 100 characters long, including spaces); or
• without adequate justification, it is, includes, or resembles, an official title or rank; or
• it is not a name (for example, it must not consist of or include symbols that cannot meaningfully be expressed in language e.g. / or @).

The name must consist of one name that is designated to be treated as the child's surname or family name, and one or more other names, unless the
religious or philosophical beliefs, or cultural traditions of the person’s parent(s) or living guardian(s) require the child to have only one name.

The child’s name will be registered exactly as entered below, if the name is acceptable for registration. Fees will apply if at a later date you decide to change or alter the child’s name (and the child’s previous name will appear on the certificate).

Not every relationship where two people live together (and are not married, nor in a civil union) is a de facto relationship under the law. 
Being in a de facto relationship depends on the couple’s circumstances, including the couple’s ages, the length of the relationship, the degree to which the couple are mutually committed to a shared life together, and the extent to which they make their relationship known publicly, for example, to friends and family. 
It is important that you know whether or not you are in a de facto relationship before you select the de facto relationship box. 
If you are unsure whether you are in a de facto relationship, you should get advice from a lawyer.

Application for your child’s IRD number.
If you apply for your child's IRD number, Births, Deaths and Marriages will provide Birth Registration information to Inland Revenue so that it can create your child’s IRD number and help protect it from misuse.

If you have any questions about requesting an IRD number, go to: 
• on how this information is used and protected go to www.ird.govt.nz/privacy 
• about applying for an IRD number go to : www.ird.govt.nz/how-to-find-my-ird-number or 
• phone Inland Revenue on 0800 775 247 - keyword “newborn IRD number”.

If one of the parents is a New Zealand or Australian citizen, or has New Zealand or Australian permanent residency, or is a resident of the Cook Islands, Tokelau, or Niue, the easiest way for you to get an IRD number for your child is by using this birth registration form. 
It is free to apply for an IRD number and it saves you having to get another set of forms to apply for it later.

You will need an IRD number for your child if you are applying for Working for Families Tax Credits or opening a KiwiSaver account or bank account in your child’s name.

If you apply for an IRD Number for your child, you should receive it 25 working days after posting a correct and complete Birth Registration form. The IRD number will arrive separately to your child’s Birth Certificate, if you have requested one.

If none of the parents are New Zealand or Australian citizens, or have New Zealand or Australian permanent residency, or are a resident of the Cook Islands, Tokelau, or Niue, then you may not be able to apply for an IRD number using this birth registration form.

32. I wish to apply for an IRD number for my child.

Yes ^

If yes
(a) Please choose ONE address Inland Revenue should post your child’s IRD number to:

(b) I also wish to receive my child's IRD number by email. Yes or No ^

Inland Revenue will add your child’s IRD number to your application.
If you've already applied for Working for Families payments for your baby, make sure you include your own IRD number on the birth registration form — Inland Revenue needs this to give you the payments.
When your baby is given an IRD number, Inland Revenue will add it to your Working for Families registration details for you.

Notify the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) of the birth
If you are an existing Ministry of Social Development (MSD) client you should notify MSD to determine how your new baby changes your benefits and services. You can choose to have Births, Deaths and Marriages notify MSD when the birth is registered. MSD will then contact you as quickly as possible to discuss how your benefits and services will change. 
This means you do not need to provide a birth certificate to MSD and may not need to visit an MSD office.

MSD may need to contact you and / or ask for further verification to help them determine this.
