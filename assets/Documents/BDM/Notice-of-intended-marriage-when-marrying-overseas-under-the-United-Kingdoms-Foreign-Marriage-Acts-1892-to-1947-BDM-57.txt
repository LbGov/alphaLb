BDM57

Notice of Intended Marriage, when marrying overseas under the United Kingdom's Foreign Marriage Acts 1892 to 1947.

Read this carefully.

If you are intending to marry in the United Kingdom (or other place where the law of the United Kingdom applies to marriages), you may be required by the United Kingdom's laws to lodge a notice in New Zealand relating to your intended marriage. Please ask the authorities in the place where you are intending to marry about whether you need to complete any requirements before you leave New Zealand. 

You can lodge a notice of your intended marriage if you have been resident in New Zealand for at least 7 days and are: 
A New Zealand citizen; or
A United Kingdom national; or
A citizen of another Commonwealth country; or
A citizen of the Republic of Ireland.
And
You intend to marry a citizen/national of one of those places in the United Kingdom; or
You intend to marry outside New Zealand in accordance with the Foreign Marriage Acts 1892 to 1947 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

If the above applies to you continue completing the following pages of the BDM 57 form, otherwise contact Births, Deaths and Marriages for more information.

If you are aged under 20 then you must also obtain consent from each of your parents.

As part of completing the notice form, you need to make a statutory declaration that states that there is no lawful impediment to the marriage (i.e. no legal reason that you cannot marry), that the details you give are true, that the bride and groom are not within the "prohibited degrees of relationship" as set out in Schedule 2 of the Marriage Act 1955 and that parental consent has been given, where relevant.

Once Births, Deaths and Marriages has received and processed your notice, a Certificate (that notice has been given of marriage intended to be solemnised out of New Zealand) may be issued after a statutory period of 14 days.
