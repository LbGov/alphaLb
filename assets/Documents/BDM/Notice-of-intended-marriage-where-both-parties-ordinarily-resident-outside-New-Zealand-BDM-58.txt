Notes: Please produce evidence of dissolution of any previous marriages and civil unions.
At least 3 days' notice of intended marriage is required.

If you live in New Zealand or will be in New Zealand at least three days before you intend to be married (either one or both parties) complete the Notice of Intended Marriage (BDM 60) form. You cannot complete the form online, as one of the parties must complete a statutory declaration (part of the form). The statutory declaration must be made in the presence of a Registrar of Marriages. This must be done in person.

If you both live outside New Zealand and will arrive in New Zealand less than three days before the date you want to marry, you may be able to complete most of the formalities before you arrive in New Zealand. You will need to complete a Notice of Intended Marriage where Parties Ordinarily Resident outside New Zealand (BDM 58) form. If you are overseas, you can complete everything on the form except the declaration, and send it (with payment) to the Registry Office in New Zealand closest to where you will be married. 

When you arrive in New Zealand, you then need to visit that office, sign the declaration before a Registrar of Marriages and collect the marriage licence. Or, the declaration must be signed by a Commonwealth Representative, and then sent (with payment) to the Registry Office in New Zealand closest to where you will be married. If it is convenient, you can have the declaration witnessed by a Commonwealth Representative, for instance, at our London or Sydney office. Note: only the Notice of Intended Marriage where both parties ordinarily resident outside New Zealand (BDM 58) can be signed by a Commonwealth representative.

What are the legal requirements for all marriage ceremonies?

The legal requirements are that:
The marriage must be performed by a Marriage Celebrant or Registrar of Marriages at the place(s) specified on the marriage licence; and
The marriage must be performed in the presence of at least two witnesses; and
During the ceremony, and before at least two witnesses, each party must say the words "I AB take you CD, to be my legal wife/husband" or words to similar effect; and
Both parties and witnesses must sign the registration forms (Copy of Particulars of Marriage).

Both parties must sign the registration forms using their pre-married signatures according to their names on the Marriage Licence. For example, if one party intends to assume the other party's surname on marriage, they must sign the registration forms using their usual signature.

Children may act as witnesses if they understand the importance of the part they take in the recording of the marriage and can demonstrate that understanding in court if later required to do so. 

What must the Marriage Celebrant do at the marriage ceremony? 

The Marriage Celebrant must officiate at the marriage ceremony. This includes:
The formal identification of the parties named on the marriage licence (the celebrant must be satisfied that the persons about to be joined are in fact those named on the marriage licence); and
The exchange of the marriage vows; and
After both copies of the registration papers (Copy of Particulars of Marriage) have been signed and witnessed, the Marriage Celebrant must return the Registrar's copy to the issuing Registry Office within 10 calendar days - the couple keep the other copy; and
The Marriage Celebrant must take all reasonable steps to ensure the marriage is registered with Births, Deaths and Marriages.

Persons other than the Marriage Celebrant may be involved in the ceremony by, for instance, reading a poem.

There should be no doubt in the eyes of the couple, witnesses and attendees that the marriage ceremony was performed by a Marriage Celebrant.

What must the Registrar of Marriages do at a Registry Office marriage ceremony?

The Registrar of Marriages must officiate at the marriage ceremony. This includes:
The formal identification of the parties named on the marriage licence (the Registrar must be satisfied that the persons about to be joined are in fact those named on the marriage licence); and
The exchange of the marriage vows; and
After both copies of the registration papers (Copy of Particulars of Marriage) have been signed and witnessed, the Registrar will retain the Registrar's copy so that the marriage can be registered - the couple keep the other copy; and
The Registrar must take all reasonable steps to ensure the marriage is registered with Births, Deaths and Marriages. 

Registry Office Ceremonies.

There are limitations on the time the ceremony takes (usually 10 minutes), the space for guests and other persons may not generally be involved in the ceremony.
