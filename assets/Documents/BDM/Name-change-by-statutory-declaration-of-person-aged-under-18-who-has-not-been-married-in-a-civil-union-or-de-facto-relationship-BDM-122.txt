A new name change certificate can be made available after registration, on payment of an additional fee.

All legal guardians must sign.
The guardians of the person whose name is to be changed should give all the information requested on this form about themselves and about that person.
If the person whose name is to be changed is aged 16 or 17, that person must sign the panel giving his or her consent to the name change (that signature does not have to be witnessed).

The child’s father and mother are usually joint guardians.
The father and the mother of a child are guardians jointly of the child unless the child’s mother is the sole guardian of the child. If the child is legally adopted by opposite-sex or same-sex parents, those parents are guardians of the child through the adoption.

Father as guardian.
The mother and father are both guardians if they jointly registered the birth of the child on or after 1 July 2005 by completing and signing the Notification of Birth for Registration form (BDM27).
The father is usually a guardian of the child if the father’s particulars were added to the child’s birth information on or after 1 July 2005 but no later than 24 January 2009.

The mother is the sole guardian.
If a child is conceived before 1 July 2005, the child’s mother is the sole guardian of the child if the mother was not:
Married to, nor in a civil union with, the father of the child at any time during the period beginning with the conception of the child and ending with the birth of the child; and not
Living with the father of the child as a de facto partner at the time the child was born.

If a child is conceived on or after 1 July 2005, the child’s mother is the sole guardian of the child if the mother was not:
Married to, nor in a civil union with, the father of the child at any time during the period beginning with the conception of the child and ending with the birth of the child; and not
Living with the father of the child as a de facto partner at any time during that period.

If the child is born as a result of an assisted reproduction procedure (such as donor insemination) to a mother acting alone, and the donor is not the mother’s partner (i.e. not in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship), and the donor does not become the mother’s partner between conception and notification of the birth for registration, then the mother is the sole guardian.

Appointment of 1 or more additional guardians.
A testamentary guardian of the child appointed by the deceased parent under section 26(2) of the Care of Children Act 2004 or section 7(2) of the Guardianship Act 1968.
All Court appointed/approved guardians. A certified copy of the Court appointment as a guardian should be attached to this declaration.

A guardian may act alone.
In some circumstances a guardian may act alone if the other guardian(s) is/are dead, unknown, missing (note that a guardian is not missing if others know of their whereabouts but they refuse to tell you), of unsound mind or unable to act because of a medical condition; or
If Family Court approval is obtained. Appropriate evidence must be attached to this declaration (note that this is not a Parenting or Protection order). 

Other parent.
If the child was born as a result of an assisted human reproduction procedure (such as artificial insemination), and the mother was living in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship with a man or a woman who had consented to her undergoing the procedure, and the man’s or woman’s name is recorded on the child’s birth registration, then that man or woman must also sign this declaration.
