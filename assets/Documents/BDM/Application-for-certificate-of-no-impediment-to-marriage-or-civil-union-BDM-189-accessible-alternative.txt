Application for Certificate of No Impediment to Marriage or Civil Union.
He tono mo tetahi Tiwhikete mo te Aweto-Kore ki te Marena, Hono a-Ture ranei.

If you are getting married or entering into a civil union outside New Zealand it is important that you contact the authorities in that country to check their laws and requirements and allow a minimum statutory period of 14 days, but as a general rule, you should allow four weeks if your document also requires Authentication. 

Definitions.

Certificate of No Impediment to Marriage/Civil Union:
Certain overseas countries require a Certificate of No Impediment to Marriage/Civil Union before allowing you to marry or enter into a civil union. The certificate is evidence that after searches and inquiries, no lawful impediment to the intended marriage/civil union has been shown to exist in your country of citizenship or residence, and according to New Zealand laws you are eligible to be married or enter into a civil union.

Your Certificate of No Impediment to Marriage/Civil Union may require an Apostille or Authentication.
Apostilled or e-Apostilled certificate. This confirms that the person who signed the document has the authority to do so and that the document should therefore be recognised as legal without further evidence in another country which has joined the Hague Convention.
Authenticated certificate. This confirms that the person who signed the document has the authority to do so and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade verifies the signature and seal of the Department of Internal Affairs.

For more information about Apostille or authentication refer to www.dia.govt.nz/Document-authentication

Who signs?
The person intending to get married or enter into a civil union outside New Zealand must complete and sign this application.

We will write to your parents, relative or a friend.
Your parent/s, relative or friend will be sent a letter asking that they confirm that they know of no lawful impediment to you marrying/entering into a civil union. Please ensure the address you provide for them is accurate as your certificate will not be issued until Births, Deaths and Marriages has received their letter in response. Please indicate if either parent is deceased.

Registration of Overseas Marriages/Civil Unions in New Zealand.
If you have married or entered into a civil union overseas and wish to confirm that your overseas marriage or civil union is valid in New Zealand you may apply to the Family Court for a declaration as to the validity of the marriage/civil union. Contact a lawyer to discuss whether it is necessary to obtain a declaration. Your marriage/civil union should be registered in the country where it takes place. There is no legal requirement to have an overseas marriage registered in New Zealand. Overseas civil unions can not be registered in New Zealand.

Marriages in an overseas country may be registered in New Zealand only if an officer from a New Zealand Embassy or High Commission attends the marriage ceremony. A certificate may then be sent by the Embassy/High Commission to the Registrar-General, and the marriage details are then able to be recorded in the New Zealand marriage register. You should liaise with the New Zealand Embassy or High Commission prior to the marriage taking place to establish whether a New Zealand representative is available to attend. Fees may be payable to the Embassy or High Commission for this service.

If you require a Single Status certificate.
Some countries require a single status certificate, or a similarly named document, as evidence that you are single for the purpose of immigration or for a work permit etc. While Births, Deaths and Marriages do not have such a product, we do provide for a Certificate of Search that states that a search of the marriage and civil union registers has been carried out from a certain date (usually when the applicant turned 16).

General Information.
What else might need to be done after the certificate is issued?
For marriages/civil unions in some countries, the representative of that country in New Zealand must endorse the Certificate of No Impediment before it is sent. The fee for this service is in addition to the fee payable in respect of the notice.

How much time should I allow for this?
Once Births, Deaths and Marriages has received and processed the application, a Certificate of No Impediment will not be issued until after a minimum statutory period of 14 days, but as a general rule, you should allow four weeks if your document also requires Authentication.

Does the certificate have a validity period?
Some countries may treat a Certificate of No Impediment as valid only for a certain period after its issue date.

How much does it cost?
The base fee is NZ$170.00 but there may be additional costs depending on the country you intend to get married in.

Where can I find more information?
Country specific information about the process, fee and timeframe to apply for a Certificate of No Impediment is available at www.bdm.govt.nz. Alternatively contact Births, Deaths and Marriages or the appropriate Embassy/Consulate for further details.
