What are the legal requirements for all marriage ceremonies? 

The legal requirements are that: 
The marriage must be performed by a Marriage Celebrant or Registrar of Marriages at the place(s) specified on the marriage licence; and
The marriage must be performed in the presence of at least two witnesses; and
During the ceremony, and before at least two witnesses, each party must say the words
"I AB take you CD, to be my legal wife/husband" or words to similar effect; and
Both parties and witnesses must sign the registration forms (Copy of Particulars of Marriage).

Both parties must sign the registration forms using their pre-married signatures according to their names on the Marriage Licence. For example, if one party intends to assume the other party's surname on marriage,
they must sign the registration forms using their usual signature. 

Children may act as witnesses if they understand the importance of the part they take in the recording of the marriage and can demonstrate that understanding in court if later required to do so. 

What must the Marriage Celebrant do at the marriage ceremony? 

The Marriage Celebrant must officiate at the marriage ceremony. This includes:
The formal identification of the parties named on the marriage licence (the celebrant must be satisfied that the persons about to be joined are in fact those named on the marriage licence); and
The exchange of the marriage vows; and
After both copies of the registration papers (Copy of Particulars of Marriage) have been signed and witnessed, the Marriage Celebrant must return the Registrars copy to the issuing Registry Office within 10 calendar days - the couple keep the other copy; and
The Marriage Celebrant must take all reasonable steps to ensure the marriage is registered with Births, Deaths and Marriages. 

Persons other than the Marriage Celebrant may be involved in the ceremony by, for instance, reading a poem. 

There should be no doubt in the eyes of the couple, witnesses and attendees that the marriage ceremony was performed by a Marriage Celebrant. 

What must the Registrar of Marriages do at a Registry Office marriage ceremony? 

The Registrar of Marriages must officiate at the marriage ceremony. This includes:
The formal identification of the parties named on the marriage licence (the Registrar must be satisfied that
the persons about to be joined are in fact those named on the marriage licence); and
The exchange of the marriage vows; and
After both copies of the registration papers (Copy of Particulars of Marriage) have been signed and
witnessed, the Registrar will retain the Registrars copy so that the marriage can be registered - the couple keep the other copy; and
The Registrar must take all reasonable steps to ensure the marriage is registered with Births, Deaths and Marriages. 

Registry Office Ceremonies.
Please be aware if you are considering having a Registry Office ceremony that they are standardised to meet the legislative requirements of getting married, which includes standard marriage vows. 
There are limitations on the time the ceremony takes (usually 10 minutes), the space for guests and other persons may not generally be involved in the ceremony. Contact the Registry Office where you 
intend to get married to discuss the arrangements. You may book a Registry Office ceremony at the same time as you give notice of your intended marriage and pay the fee.
