Consent to Civil Union of a Person aged 16 or 17.
Whakaaetanga Hononga ā-Ture o tētahi Tangata kei ngā tau 16, 17 rānei

Important. 1. Normally the consent of each of the person’s guardians is required. This will usually be the person’s parents, but may include other people who are appointed as guardians.
2. Consent is not required from a guardian who cannot be found, or who is unable to give consent because of incapacity (such as a severe mental disability).
3. If all of the person’s guardians cannot be found or are unable to act because of incapacity, then consent must be given by a relative acting in the place of a guardian, or from a Family Court Judge.
4. Separate forms should be used when the consent of more than one person is required.
